# The Made Tech Support Team

## High level overview

Our Support Team is best thought of as the 'on-demand' equivalent to our AaaS offering. They undertake smaller tactical pieces of work which normally would necessitate the spinning up of a dedicated Sprint team. The length of work undertaken varies from less than an hour, up to about a month. Beyond that our AaaS offering becomes more appropriate.

The Support Team is run by Nick Wood, who oversees day to day operations, and manages relationships with our support customers.  

## Support Team Structure

The support team doesn't have a fixed roster of staff and instead consists of a number of developers based availibility of staff and customer demand for support work. The support team is formed of:
 * The **'Triage Team'**, a core rota of staff each contributing a day or more of their week to oversee intake of new issues, and fixing small and critical issues.
 * A variable number of **'Support Pairs'**. These pairs are stable from week to week, and generally have an overarching goal which spans many weeks.

## Support issue lifecycle

All support issues begin life as an email into support@madetech.com. These are forwarded automatically into our GrooveHQ inbox to be sorted by the Triage Team. We aim to resolve all new issues within 48 hours with one of the following resolutions:
* Fix issue if it can be done so in < 2 hours
* Fix issue if it is causing significant business impact to customer
* If it is a larger piece of work, and/or non-urgent then it should be moved to the customer's backlog in Trello, where it can be prioritised against other work, and potentially scheduled in for a Support Pair to complete.

Each Customer has their own Trello board for prioritising work. Issues are grouped differently for each customer but each board has the following 3 columns:
1. 'New Issues' this is anything that's been backlogged from a Groove issue.
2. 'Up next' issues will be automatically copied to our Support Epics board where they can be scheduled and assigned.
3. 'Recently Completed' issues are things which have been completed in the last week or so.

## Support Planning

During a weekly call (bi-weekly for some) with each customer Nick and the customer will agree to a commitment of work to be completed the following week by the support team. These issues will be moved to the 'Up Next' column, and copied to the Support Epics board.

By Thursday of each week the Support Epics board will have:
 * A list of items that can be reasonably completed by support pairs in the upcoming week, and have a pair assigned to them.
 * A list of 'Triage Team' items, which can reasonably be completed by memebers of the Triage Team around core Triage work.

## Working in a Support Pair

If you're on a Support Pair then it is your responsibility to:
 * Ensure you know at the start of each week what your pair will be working on, and have a goal in mind for the Scrum of Scrums.
 * Book in at least one showcase with the customer that week so they can see what progress ahs been made towards the goal.
 * At the end of each day record your time in Harvest against the relevant customer. You should also include a brief description of the work carried out.
 * Communicate regulalarly with the customer especially around deployments so they can plan any testing they may want to do.

## Working in Team Triage

If you're working on Team Triage then it is your responsibility to:
 * Know which days you are on Triage duty, and swap days in advance if you're unable to.
 * Work towards the Triage goal of resolving everything within 48 hours (NB. Backlogging an issue is an accepted resolution)
 * Call for help from others if there is more triage work than you can resonably handle
 * Record all time spent in Harvest against the respoective customers
 * Handover any incomplete issues to whoever is on Triage the following day.
