# Remote test

This is our current remote test for screening candidates. We provide a candidate with both a brief and a marking guide that clearly explains what we are looking for technically. The purpose of this test is to measure a candidate's exposure to well known best practices, and also in the absence of exposure, measure their ability to find the answer.

In order to proceed to the next step, a candidate must achieve 80% mark or more.

 - [Rails Marking Guide](marking_guide.md)
 - PHP Marking Guide (coming soon)
 - JavaScript Marking Guide (coming soon)

## Things to tell candidate

When sending the remote test to a candidate please make them aware of the following.

A few things to note:

 - We ask you to complete this test within 7 days. If you run out of time please get back in touch with us and we can give you an extension (you won't be penalised)
 - Use the marking guide as a checklist before you submit your application
 - There are no trick questions, we just want to see if you can complete the steps in the brief
 - You are not expected to do anything beyond the brief
 - You can ask as many questions as you like
