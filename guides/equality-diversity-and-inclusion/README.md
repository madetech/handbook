# Equality, Diversity & Inclusion at Made Tech

Creating a better, fairer society is part of our purpose as an organisation. This starts with our people.

We strive to make Made Tech an equitable, diverse and inclusive workplace and to provide a working environment that is free from discrimination at all times.

We recognise that our different backgrounds, experiences, views, beliefs, cultures and physical/neurological differences represented enrich us as a company and as individuals. We embrace diversity in all of our activities and acknowledge that variety and difference are integral to the success and future development of our business.
