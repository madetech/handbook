# Equality, Diversity & Inclusion at Made Tech

Creating a better, fairer society is part of our purpose as an organisation. This starts with our people.

We strive to make Made Tech an equitable, diverse and inclusive workplace and to provide a working environment that is free from discrimination at all times.

We recognise that our different backgrounds, experiences, views, beliefs, cultures and physical/neurological differences represented enrich us as a company and as individuals. We embrace diversity in all of our activities and acknowledge that variety and difference are integral to the success and future development of our business.

## Teams and communities

We have a number of ways we support equality, diversity and inclusion at Made Tech.

We have a diversity and inclusion service team who are responsible for defining our strategy, setting KPIs and objectives, supporting the wider organisation to take action to deliver on these objectives, and reporting on progress to our leadership team. This team is an escalation point for D&I related issues and manages the operation of equality data collection and reporting. 

We have a regular forum, our diversity and inclusion community meetup for discussing diversity and inclusion matters, scrutinising decisions being made by the diversity and inclusion service team, and making suggestions for future strategy.

We support open and closed community groups that meet to share experiences, raise issues and promote various aspects of diversity and inclusion. Open communities are free for anyone to join while closed communities are available to join by invite if you identify as belonging to that community.
