# Diversity and inclusion service team

The diversity and inclusion service team are responsible for and empowered to shape and deliver changes to drive improvements that lead to Made Tech being a more diverse and inclusive place to work. We see this as a necessary ongoing investment needed to ensure equal opportunities are brought about by our work and that we maintain an inclusive culture as we grow.

Specifically, the diversity and inclusion service team is funded to and is responsible for:

- Defining our strategy
- Setting KPIs and objectives
- Co-creating change plans with other service teams
- Supporting the wider organisation to take action to deliver on these objectives
- Reporting on progress to our leadership team
- Being an escalation point with the ability to raise issues at an executive and board-level
- Manage operation of equality data collection
- Reporting on equality data to drive future decisions and investments
- Running the [diversity and inclusion community](about-di-community.md)
- Supporting [open and closed communities](about-open-and-closed-community.md) to form and operate

## Membership

It is a requirement that an executive director and a member of the leadership team are members of the service team to ensure the team continues to have sufficient authority to make necessary decisions.

We will run an open recruitment process for other membership places of no less than two places being available per quarter to anyone at Made Tech.

## Meetings

The service team shall meet with all available members on a weekly basis to review goals, committed actions and issues. The meeting is 45 minutes and is run by the team’s directly responsible individual or a nominated other.

The service team is also responsible for ensuring the diversity and inclusion community  meets on a regular basis.

Minutes for these meetings are publically available.

## Managing issues

The service team shall be available for issues to be raised via members of the diversity and inclusion community, open/closed communities or any other individual at Made Tech. Details on who to raise issues to should be documented in the [#supply-diversity-and-inclusion](https://madetechteam.slack.com/archives/CRAJF24CR) Slack channel.

We have documented general guidance on [raising an issue](../welfare/raising_an_issue.md) elsewhere in the Handbook.
