## Taking Made Tech laptops abroad

If you’re off on holiday we’d suggest that you shouldn’t be taking your laptop with you, however if you’re planning on working anywhere outside of the UK, here are some steps you need to take before you do: 

- Talk to your DM and the People Team first, to ensure you have permission to work outside of the UK (some clients will not allow this).
- Contact Operations via slack #ops-it-support or email [operations@madetech.com](mailto:operations@madetech.com) to let them know. 
- When using your laptop outside of the UK ensure you are using the Made tech VPN. If this is not installed please see [instructions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14w3BXtsrgUqRmJ73QFhGXiCo3ufjvMmI) on how to do that before you go.
