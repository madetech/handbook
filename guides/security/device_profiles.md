Made Tech uses standard builds for the devices issued to team members to facilitate support and maintenance, and help enforce security standards. 

As part of our commitment to secure working practices and maintaining our current Cyber Essential Plus (CE+) Certification, we install separate admin and user device profiles on laptops. This restriction prevents the accidental downloading and installation of malicious software on company devices and protects both Made Tech and our customers.

An application called ThreatLocker is installed on all Macs. When an application install is required that needs admin privileges, ThreatLocker will either allow you to proceed if the application is pre-approved or present the option to request the level of access needed to install the app. More information is available [here](https://aura.eu.itglue.com/1102831304982679/docs/3345396642005183).

The situation for Linux users is slightly different. More information is available [here](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/guides/it/linux_av.md).
