Made Tech uses standard builds for the devices issued to team members to facilitate support and maintenance, and help enforce security standards. 

As part of our commitment to secure working practices and maintaining our current Cyber Essential Plus (CE+) Certification, we install separate admin and user device profiles on laptops. This restriction prevents the accidental downloading and installation of malicious software on company devices and protects both Made Tech and our customers.

Team members can request access to admin permissions by emailing [support@systemagic.co.uk](mailto:support@systemagic.co.uk) requesting admin access with details of the purpose for access e.g upgrading system software. Systemagic will respond to requests between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday. Access should be used only in line with the purpose detailed in the request. You must not log into the admin account on your laptop directly.

We acknowledge this is not a perfect solution and are looking for alternatives which are more user friendly whilst also being CE+ compliant. 

The situation for Linux users is slightly different. More information is available [here](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/guides/it/linux_av.md)
