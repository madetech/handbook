# Visitors and Office Security

Keeping our physical surroundings safe is an important part of ensuring our work remains secure. Robust office security ensures we maintain the safety of our buildings, team members, and visitors.

## Planning ahead
Please ensure that all visitors are booked into the relevant office in advance using the Office RnD system. You can find more information on how to do this, and book them a desk if required, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wCGrHN-prrUt8RnyNux2MshCTQ36D_rvTKTeu1qJwMk/edit#) (internal link). 

## On arrival
Ask all visitors to check in using the Office RnD app on the iPad. The member of the team they are here to visit will be alerted by email and Slack but you can also let them know directly. Please keep the visitor in the relevant waiting area until a team member arrives - don't let them wander around the office alone.
Visitors should be given a visitor lanyard.

If someone tries to enter the office and you feel uncomfortable, you are within your rights to challenge their reasons for entry (gently).

### Unauthorised Access
Attackers may attempt to gain access to our offices in order to do Made Tech or our clients harm. They may use techniques to gain your trust, take advantage of inattention, or capitalise on your desire to be helpful to gain access.

**Remain vigilant for:**
- Anyone you do not recognise trying to gain access to (or already in) the office
- Anyone trying to follow you into the communal stairway or office
- Anyone trying to observe the access codes for the communal stairway or Made Tech office
- Anyone who cannot provide a credible reason for gaining access to the building or office
- Anyone who cannot name the member of the Made Tech team they are visiting
- Anyone trying to pressure you for information about our building or office

Remember, it is always ok to (politely) challenge any request for access from an unknown individual.
If you are an employee and a team member is challenging you, please remember they are just trying to be security conscious so help them out and demonstrate you work here.
