# Guidance for Security Cleared Staff

## General information
There are 3 routes for requesting Security Clearance (SC) and the route taken depends on the project.
- Home Office - for Home Office projects only
- MoJ - for MOJ projects only
- Warwickshire Police - this is currently the default route for all SC and transfers

All new joiners are asked whether they already have SC and if so a process is started to transfer that clearance to Made Tech.

### Timings
Via the Warwickshire Police route we pay extra for the premium service which fast tracks the application in 25 days HOWEVER that is 25 days from the point the application and all relevant information has been received. That requires the individual being cleared to fill out the forms and provide all supporting information when asked.

### Updates
The [tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19pQ9r3HI44oYv6nDKtteXGIkdtMla_8X/edit#gid=1771661157) (internal link) will be updated as we are given updates but be aware, once the application is underway updates are very limited and mostly go to the candidate.

### Source of truth
The source of truth for who in the company has been SC cleared is Kimble. There is a report available [internally here](https://madetech.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00O8e000001BAVhEAO/view)


## How to request Security Clearance
Put a request in the #supply-sc slack channel with the following info:
- Full name
- Email address
- Project/client
- Perm or contractor
- Start date (if they haven't started yet)
- Tag the individual so they are automatically added to the channel
- Tag Cam for Home Office or Vikki for Warwickshire Police

Vikki or Cam will acknowledge the request, put the individual into the spreadsheet and kick off the process.


## Information for individuals
More detailed information and the relevant documents for individuals starting or going through the SC process is available [internally here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hSax2iN6sE3EQJ7bWEe4xQCKhj-Dum2z)


## Change in circumstances
Certain changes in personal circumstances require you to notify the government. This applies if you:
- Get married, enter a Civil Partnership or start living with a partner as a couple
- Are arrested, are refused bail, receive a Police caution, reprimand or final warning or are convicted of an offence (other than minor road traffic offences)
- Acquire a new nationality or renounce one that you previously held
- There is a significant change in your financial circumstances, either by making it more difficult or by improving it. 

In these circumstances, you must inform the People Team who will assist you to notify the relevant authority.
