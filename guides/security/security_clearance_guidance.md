# Guidance for Security Cleared Staff

## General information & timings
There are different routes for requesting Security Clearance (SC) and the route taken depends on the project. There is [more information here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hVPR5nvnbwzkAcZHogTqKl8HHpACZKwHyXayB3lr0SY/edit) (internal link). 

If you are joining Made Tech and have questions about the process please ask your Community Manager or contact from the Talent Team who can send on the relevant information.  

All new joiners are asked whether they already have SC and if so a process is started to transfer that clearance to Made Tech.

### Timings
Timings to be cleared are a minimum of 25 working days (5 weeks) from the point the application and all relevant information has been received. However it is usual for timings to be significantly longer.

### Updates
The [tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19pQ9r3HI44oYv6nDKtteXGIkdtMla_8X/edit#gid=1771661157) (internal link) will be updated as we are given updates but be aware, once the application is underway updates are very limited and mostly go to the candidate.

### Source of truth
The source of truth for who in the company has been SC cleared is Kimble. There is a report available [internally here](https://madetech.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00O8e000001BAVhEAO/view).

## How to request Security Clearance
Put a request in the #supply-sc slack channel with the following info:
- Full name
- Email address
- Project/client
- Perm or contractor
- Start date (if they haven't started yet)
- Tag the individual so they are automatically added to the channel
- Tag the relevant person from the People Team for the route required.

The People Team will acknowledge the request, put the individual into the spreadsheet and kick off the process.


## Information for individuals
More detailed information and the relevant documents for individuals starting or going through the SC process is available [internally here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hSax2iN6sE3EQJ7bWEe4xQCKhj-Dum2z).


## Change in circumstances
Certain changes in personal circumstances require you to notify the government. This applies if you:
- Get married, enter a Civil Partnership or start living with a partner as a couple
- Are arrested, are refused bail, receive a Police caution, reprimand or final warning or are convicted of an offence (other than minor road traffic offences)
- Acquire a new nationality or renounce one that you previously held
- There is a significant change in your financial circumstances, either by making it more difficult or by improving it. 

In these circumstances, you must inform the People Team who will assist you to notify the relevant authority.
More information on this is available [internally here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nExumOwtA9rDtTyih94r8sD8CN9pc-Dl4apDA7PrPh8/edit#heading=h.lk7u9et1xly3).
