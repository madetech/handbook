# IT Hardware

Ops look after all the laptops and other IT infrastructure in the offices. For accessories such as monitors, keyboards, etc. take a look [here](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/benefits/work_ready.md) and speak to your ever helpful Community Manager.

### Laptops
Everyone at Made Tech will be given a laptop aligned to the role they do. The Linux users in Made Tech would like to specifically highlight that Engineers can request Linux machines :)

The current standard laptop specs for new purchases are:

**Engineers and UCD**
- 14‐inch MacBook Pro
- Apple M1 Pro with 8-core CPU, 14-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
- 16GB unified memory
- 512GB SSD storage

OR

- Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 14 Inch
- Core i7-10510U Processor  @ 1.80GHz - 4 cores
- 16GB of RAM
- 512GB SSD
- Windows 10 Pro

**All other roles**
- Macbook Air
- Apple M1 chip with 8‐core CPU, 7‐core GPU and 16‐core Neural Engine
  8GB unified memory
- 256GB SSD storage1

You may have or receive a laptop with a slightly different spec - these are older machines which are still within the 3 year replacement period (see below).

Standard laptop specs will be reviewed annually, and as and when Apple change their specs. The last review was November 2022.

If there is an issue with your laptop please email [support@systemagic.co.uk](mailto:support@systemagic.co.uk)

## Laptop replacement cycles

Laptops are replaced every 3 years, according to the age of the individual laptop, not how long a user has had it. When your laptop is due for replacement you'll be contacted by Systemagic or Ops to arrange for a new one to be given to you and return of the old one.

New laptops will be whatever the standard spec is for your role at that time.

When they've been returned, laptops are traded in or recycled, depending on what state they're in.

- If a laptop is not eligible for trade-in (e.g. has icloud lock, is too damaged, not working, no value) then Systemagic performs a full disk wipe and the laptop is recycled by https://greenmachinecomputers.com/
- If a laptop has a trade-in value then Systemagic performs a full disk wipe and prepares it to be in best condition to maximise trade-in valuation (e.g. stickers removed, residue scrubbed off, device cleaned). The laptop is valued through https://www.stormfront.co.uk/trade-in then sent to a trade-in partner for analysis. Any payment received is credited to MadeTech’s next invoice.
