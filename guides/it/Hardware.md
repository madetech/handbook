# IT Hardware

Ops look after all the laptops and other IT infrastructure in the offices. For accessories such as monitors, keyboards, etc. take a look [here](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/benefits/work_ready.md) or slack to #ops.

### Laptops
Everyone at Made Tech will be given a laptop aligned to the role they do. The Linux users in Made Tech would like to specifically highlight that Engineers can request Linux machines :)

The current standard laptop specs for new purchases are:

**Engineers and UCD**
- MacBook Pro (14 inch)
- Apple M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
- 16GB unified memory
- 512GB SSD storage

Please note that you can only have 1 external monitor set up with this laptop. We will be changing to M3 Pro chips which allow 2 external monitors.

OR

- ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 14 inch
- Core i7-1355U Processor (E-cores up to 3.70 GHz P-cores up to 5.00 GHz)
- 16GB of RAM
- 512GB SSD
- Integrated Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics
- Windows or Linux

**All other roles**
- Air M2 (13 inch)
- Apple M2 chip with 8‐core CPU, 10‐core GPU and 16‐core Neural Engine
- 16GB unified memory
- 256GB SSD storage

You may have or receive a laptop with a slightly different spec - these are older machines which are still within the 3 or 4 year replacement period (see below).

Standard laptop specs will be reviewed annually, and as and when Apple change their specs. The last review was March 2024.

If there is an issue with your laptop please email [it@madetech.com](mailto:it@madetech.com)

## Laptop replacement cycles

**Engineers and UCD** - laptops are currently replaced every 3 years, according to the age of the individual laptop, not how long a user has had it. This will be changing to every 4 years for laptops with an M3 Pro chip.

**All other roles** - laptops are replaced every 4 years, according to the age of the individual laptop, not how long a user has had it. 

When your laptop is due for replacement you'll be contacted by Aura to arrange for a new one to be given to you and return of the old one. You do not have to have a replacement - if you're perfectly happy with the laptop you currently have then great. You can request a replacement at any point after the 3 or 4 year mark, whichever is applicable. New laptops will be whatever the standard spec is for your role at that time.
