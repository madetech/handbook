# IT Hardware

Aura look after all the laptops and other IT infrastructure in the offices. For all laptop issues or questions please email them directly [it@madetech.com](mailto:it@madetech.com). 
For accessories such as monitors, keyboards, etc. take a look [here](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/benefits/work_ready.md).

### Laptops
Everyone at Made Tech will be given a laptop aligned to the role they do. The Linux users in Made Tech would like to specifically highlight that Engineers can request Linux machines :)

The current standard laptop specs for new purchases are:

**Engineers and UCD**
- MacBook Pro (14inch standard display)
- Apple M4 with 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
- 32GB unified memory
- 512GB SSD storage

OR

- ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 or 12 14 inch
- Core i7-1355U Processor (E-cores up to 3.70 GHz P-cores up to 5.00 GHz)
- 16GB or 32GB of RAM
- 512GB SSD
- Windows or Linux

(Gen, processor, memory and overall spec can vary on the ThinkPads - we'll talk to you individually about options.)

**All other roles**
- Air M3 (13 inch)
- Apple M3 chip with 8‐core CPU, 8‐core GPU and 16‐core Neural Engine
- 16GB unified memory
- 256GB SSD storage

You may have or receive a laptop with a slightly different spec - these are older machines which are still within the 3 or 4 year replacement period (see below).

Standard laptop specs will be reviewed annually, and as and when Apple change their specs. The last review was January 2025.

If there is an issue with your laptop please email [it@madetech.com](mailto:it@madetech.com)

## Laptop replacement cycles

**Engineers and UCD** - laptops are currently replaced every 3 years, according to the age of the individual laptop, not how long a user has had it.

**All other roles** - laptops are replaced every 4 years, according to the age of the individual laptop, not how long a user has had it. 

Please note - the replacement is due on the date the laptop was bought by Made Tech, it it not based on the model year of the laptop.

When your laptop is due for replacement you'll be contacted by Aura to arrange for a new one to be given to you and return of the old one. You do not have to have a replacement - if you're perfectly happy with the laptop you currently have then great. You can request a replacement at any point after the 3 or 4 year mark, whichever is applicable. New laptops will be whatever the standard spec is for your role at that time.

As of February 2025 we are running behind on replacements for Pros. We're working through in date order.
