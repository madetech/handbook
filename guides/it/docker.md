# Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables developers to separate their applications from their  infrastructure so they can deliver software quickly. With Docker, they can manage their infrastructure in the same ways they manage their applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, they can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

Due to changes within Docker, from Jan 2022 any employees using a Made Tech email address must use the Made Tech licence for Docker Desktop and not an individual licence.

## Onboarding/offboarding
If you require a Docker licence please message `it@madetech.com` with the details of the project / workstream that you need adding to. 

If you are a Delivery Manager / the Lead Engineer on a project then please ensure that you notify the Operations team if a member of your team leaves your project so that we can remove their access to that project. 

If you have left a project and are still in the team on Docker or you no longer require your licence please ensure you let the ops team know by sending a message to it@madetech.com
