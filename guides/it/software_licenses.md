## Software and licences including SaaS
Most standard software including SaaS applications will be set up as standard on your laptop when you receive it. A standard toolset is being put together and we're implementing a way for everyone to easily access and download what they need.

Some software is installed on a Mac or Windows laptops automatically which is needed to ensure we can keep the hardware safe and working, and to meet our CE+ and ISO certification criteria. Please do not attempt to remove the following software:
- Jamf - this is a management platform for our Apple devices. Jamf reports back to Systemagic and Made Tech Ops on security settings, security updates and will allow us to remotely push out settings like the Made Tech VPN connection and virus protection.
- Webroot - this is anti-virus software.

## Requesting access to software
If you need something that isn't installed please don't just go and buy it or use a free trial - we probably already have a licence and can get you set up. In some cases we may ask you to use our standard tools rather than a personal preference as we're looking to avoid duplication in having many tools performing similar or the same job. We also need to demonstrate that we have the correct measures in place to protect our data, our client's data, and their customers data and the tools we use are a key part of that.

This is not intended to place barriers in the way of teams having access to the tools they need to function, we just have to know what we're using and who is using it.

If you need access to existing software email [support@systemagic.co.uk](mailto:support@systemagic.co.uk)

If you want to try new software email [operations@madetech.com](mailto:operations@madetech.com)
They will need to know:
- What software you want, including any links if relevant
- Why you want this software
- How long you'll need this software (e.g. if it's only for a specific event or client delivery)

If a client is requesting use of a specific tool that isn't part of our standard toolset email [operations@madetech.com](mailto:operations@madetech.com)
