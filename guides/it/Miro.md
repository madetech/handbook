# Miro

All the information below and lots more useful stuff can be found on the Made Tech [Miro training board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lkgJ4BU=/) (this is an internal link to a Miro board)

## Getting access to Miro
### New starters
All new starters are automatically given a Full Miro licence when they join and are added to the Made Tech Team. 

They can be added to any board or Space in the Made Team Team by any other Made Tech Team member. To add them to another Space or client Team, that Team Admin has to invite them.

### External users
External users **cannot** be added to the Made Tech team, they can only be added to separate client team and Spaces - see Types of Team below. The Team Admin for the client or Space can invite them.

The licence options are:
- Free Restricted - viewing and commenting (this is free)
- Full - editing access (this costs us money)

### Reviews
In order to keep licence costs down, access is reviewed every quarter based on usage. If a Full licence hasnâ€™t been used in the previous 2 months it will be changed to a Free Restricted licence. This can be changed back to a Full licence at any point. The licence options are:

- Free Restricted - viewing and commenting (this is free)
- Full - editing access (this costs us money)

### Leavers
If you are leaving Made Tech; please transfer your boards to a new owner in advance. Any boards still owned by you at the point of offboarding will be transferred to a Team Admin.

Leavers are removed from the Made Tech Team as part of the offboarding process. Leavers need to be manually removed from any other client or project teams by the Team Admin, though Ops will do a clear out once a quarter.

## Types of Team
### The Made Tech Team
There is a Made Tech Team which all staff are automatically added to. This is internally facing only - external users **cannot** be added to the Made Tech team. This is so that there is no accidental sharing of internal information. 

Everyone has permissions to set up their own boards within the Made Tech Team, either as part of a Space or individually. These can be kept private, be shared with individuals or with the whole Team.

### Client & Project Teams
There are also Client and Project Teams which individuals can request to be added to, or be invited by the Team Admin. These are completely separate from the Made Tech Team, and from each other, and have been set up to ensure that we are keeping all client data in separate and secure environments. 

These Teams are administered by the Team Admin who is a member of the project team, and only relevant project team members should be invited. 

If you need a new Team creating, contact Aura via email it@madetech.com or via Slack.

To join an external team, click on the Made Tech team option at the top of your dashboard so you can see all the teams you have access to, click + Join team and a request will be sent to the admins for that team.

There is more information on Ask Made Tech - search for Miro.
