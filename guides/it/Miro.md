# Miro

All the information below and lots more useful stuff can be found on the Made Tech [Miro training board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lkgJ4BU=/) (this is an internal link to a Miro board)

## Getting access to Miro
### New starters
All new starters after November 2021 are automatically given a Free Restricted Miro licence when they join and are added to the Made Tech Team. This gives them the ability to view and comment with the option to request editing access.

They can be added to any board or project in the Made Team Team by any other Made Tech Team member. To add them to another project or client Team, that Team Admin has to invite them.

If they need access to edit then they can request it via Miro and a Miro Admin will be notified and grant that asap.

### Been here a while
Anyone from Made Tech can request a licence by emailing operations@madetech.com, or they can be invited by any other Made Tech Team member.

The licence options are:
Free Restricted - viewing and commenting (this is free)
Full - editing access (this costs us money)

### External users
External users can't be added to the Made Tech team, they can only be added to separate client and project teams. The Team Admin for the client can invite them.

The licence options are:
Free Restricted - viewing and commenting (this is free)
Full - editing access (this costs us money)

### Leavers
Leavers are removed from the Made Tech Team as part of the offboarding process. Any boards they own will be transferred to a Team Admin.

Leavers need to be manually removed from any other client or project teams by the Team Admin, though Ops will do a clear out once a quarter.

## Types of Team
### The Made Tech Team
There is a Made Tech Team which all staff are automatically a part of. This is internally facing only - external users can't be added to the Made Tech team.

Everyone has permissions to set up their own boards within the Made Tech Team, either as part of a Project folder or individually. These can be kept private, be shared with individuals or with the whole Team.

### Client & Project Teams
There are also client and project Teams which individuals can request to be added to, or be invited by the Team Admin.

Client and project Teams are administered separately from the Made Tech team. They should only be set up where external access is needed.

To get a Client or project team set up, drop a Slack in the ops channel
