## Laptop Replacement

The laptop renewal period is 3 years, which is based on the age of the laptop not the amount of time an individual has had it. Renewal is entirely optional so if you want to keep your current laptop that’s fine. 

- Systemagic will contact you to let you know the laptop is eligible for renewal. You’ll be offered a new machine in line with our agreed [Hardware Specifications](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/guides/it/Hardware.md) for your role.
- Systemagic will then arrange to send you a new laptop. 
- Once you've finished transferring any information from your old laptop you need to either send it back to Systemagic or arrange to drop it off with a member of the Ops Team in the London office. For either method please can you ensure:

  - That the device is clean (no stickers) 
  - That the charger is included
  - There is a note with your name on it so that Systemagic can identify who it’s from. 

If you are posting the laptop you need to ensure it’s suitably packaged inside a correctly sized cardboard box and has plenty of internal padding to ensure a safe return. Send it with tracking and insurance up to the value of £2000 to the following address: 
 
 <pre>
 Systemagic
 The Old Gas Warehouse
 Frome Road
 Bradford on Avon
 Wiltshire
 BA15 1HA
</pre>

We recommend using the following methods to send the laptop and charger to Systemagic:
- [Post Office Track and Trace](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/track-trace)
- [Special Next Day Delivery](https://www.royalmail.com/sending/uk/special-delivery-guaranteed-1pm)

You can expense the postage (with insurance) by sending a receipt for postage to [finance@madetech.com](finance@madetech.com). We currently do not offer an option to purchase your laptop.
