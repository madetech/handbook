# Laptop replacements

The laptop renewal period is 3 years, which is based on the age of the laptop not the amount of time an individual has had it. Renewal is entirely optional - if you want to keep your current laptop that’s fine. 

- Aura will contact you to let you know the laptop is eligible for renewal. You’ll be offered a new machine in line with our agreed [laptop specifications for your role.](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/guides/it/Hardware.md)

- Aura will then arrange to send you a new laptop. 

- Once you've finished transferring any information from your old laptop you need to either send it back to Aura or arrange to drop it off with a member of the Ops Team in the London office. For either method please can you ensure: 
- That the device is clean (no stickers)
- That the charger is included
- There is a note with your name on it so that Aura can identify who it’s from. 

If you are posting the laptop you need to ensure it’s suitably packaged and has plenty of padding to ensure a safe return. Send it with tracking and insurance to the following address: 

<pre>
Aura Technology
1-2 Trinity Court
Brunel Road
Totton
Southampton
SO40 3WX
