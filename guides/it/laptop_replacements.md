# Laptop replacements

We hold an agreement with our IT supplier, Systemagic, regarding laptop upgrades. After 3 years staff will be contacted and offered a replacement laptop. The process is summarised below:

1. Systemagic will send a quarterly report with anyone coming up to 3 years ownership of the laptop
2. Systemagic will contact individuals to let them know our policy for renewing laptops is every 3 years and theirs have come up if they'd like a replacement
3. If yes, Systemagic will organise for a new one to be sent out. The old laptop can be sent back by the individual by Royal Mail and expensed via Xero with finance made aware
4. Systemagic will update their system to show the start date of the new laptop so the clock resets
5. The old laptop will be disposed of / traded in with credit due on monthly invoice
