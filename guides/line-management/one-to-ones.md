# 121 Meetings

You should meet frequently with your direct reports for a minimum of 1 hour per month. 

During probation we recommend a 30 minute meeting every week or fortnightly to help a new person on-board successfully into Made Tech. 


## What are 121's used for?
121's are dedicated time for coaching, mentoring, and giving people space to reflect and grow:

You might talk about:

- What is expected of my role at Made Tech?
- How do I deal with this difficult thing?
- How do I progress in my career?
- Feedback, whether given or received
- Any other topic you both feel is valuable


## Our 121 tool
We use a tool called Small Improvements to schedule and take notes of all our 121's. These notes become data points that your direct reports can use to prepare for annual reviews and promotions.
A scheduled 121 will have a list of 'Talking points' (agenda) that you can setup in advance.
It's also an easy way for direct reports to ask peers for feedback and set objectives for career progression.
