# Annual Reviews

As a line manager, one of your responsibilities is to facilitate the annual reviews of the individuals you line manage. The annual review is a retrospective of the previous year, a look ahead at the coming year and typically a [salary review](../compensation/salary_reviews.md).

The annual review will take place between April and May each year. 

## What should I do to prepare?

It's recommended you advise and guide your team member to collect and collate evidence of progress and growth continually through the review period.

You should also take the time to prepare a summary of the highlights and notable events of the review period to share with your team member, and think about guidance and goals for the next review period. Try to identify key areas of growth for the coming review period, constructive feedback from the individual's team will be key to this.
