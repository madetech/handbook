# Probation at Made Tech

When someone joins Made Tech, they're "on probation" for a short time.
This means their notice period is shorter - usually one week.

At the end of probation, people either pass or fail. Most people pass.
Rarely, you'll extend probation, or pass someone early.

This guidance is written for line managers, but may be useful for people on probation too.

## What happens during probation?

In the first week, explain what probation is, and how to pass it.

Each week, meet your direct one-to-one.
Get feedback from their team, and reflect on it together.
Talk often about whether they're on-track to pass.

At the end of probation, pass or fail it, and explain what happens next.

## Explaining how to pass probation

Talk about what good looks like for their role. [The handbook role pages](../roles) may help with this.
It's good to spend the first two weeks talking about this.

Explain that feedback is useful evidence on how they're performing.

Tell your direct to ask their team for feedback. You can talk to your direct's team to help get more feedback, if needed.

### Worries about failing probation

It can be stressful to be on probation.

Explain early that:
- Most people pass
- Getting regular feedback means the result won't be a surprise
- You will guide and support them

## One-to-one meetings during probation

We don't have guidance for one-to-ones in the handbook yet.

In brief, ask your direct about their week:
- How are they feeling?
- What's gone well?
- What's been difficult?
- What have they learned?

For probation, specifically:
- Reflect on feedback together
- Talk about whether they're on-track to pass
- Offer to ask their team directly for feedback, if it's not forthcoming

If it's not clear whether they are on-track four weeks in, ask their team for feedback directly.

## Finishing probation

Make a recommendation to the Market Principal. This could be by e-mail. They have final say on whether to pass or fail probation.

### Passing probation

Congratulate your direct on passing probation. Tell them their new notice period.

If the Market Principal agrees, you can pass probation early.

### Failing probation

Tell your direct they haven't passed probation, and give them notice of termination.

We don't have guidance on how to give notice in the handbook yet. It can be difficult and stressful. Talk to the people team for support.

### Extending probation

Sometimes, it's not clear at the end of probation if someone would succeed at Made Tech long-term.

In these rare cases, work with the Market Principal to extend probation, agreeing on a fixed amount of time.

Being on probation can be stressful. Think carefully when deciding between extending and failing.

### Learning from failed probations

Failed probations sometimes mean something went wrong in our hiring.

Talk to the hiring team and the people team about a failed probation, to see if anything can be learned or changed.
