# Line management at Made Tech

Line managers help others to learn and grow, deliver great results, and progress their careers.

People who report to a line manager are called "direct reports".

This guidance isn't complete yet. If you need help, ask:
- the people team (**#team-people** on slack)
- the line manager community (**#supply-learning-line-managers** on slack)
- Yasemin Ercan, our Head of People

## What do I need to do as a line manager?

### One-to-one meetings
Hold regular one-to-one meetings, at least once a month.

See [One-to-Ones](one-to-ones)

### Probation
Help your direct reports to pass their probation period.
Work with the Market Principal to extend or fail probations, if necessary.

### Annual reviews
Hold an review once a year, reflecting on the year's highlights and challenges.
This usually includes a salary review.
This may include setting goals or themes for the coming year.

### Promotions
Help your direct report make a case for being promoted.

### Help underperforming people
Help them understand where they are underperforming.
Help them plan to improve in these areas.
As a last resort, give notice of terminating employment.
