# Line management at Made Tech

Line managers help others to learn and grow, deliver great results, and progress their careers.

People who report to a line manager are called "direct reports".

This guidance isn't complete yet. If you need help, ask:
- your own line manager
- you can search our knowledge base - Ask Made Tech, and if you can't find an answer there, feel free to raise a query
- ask one of the people partnering team
- the line manager community (**#cop-learning-line-managers** on Slack)


## What do I need to do as a line manager?

### 121 meetings
Hold regular 121 (one-to-one) meetings, at least once a month.

[See more guidance on 121s](./121s.md)

### Probation
Help your direct reports to pass their probation period.
Work with your 'Head of' to extend or fail probations, if necessary.

[See more guidance on probation](./probation.md)

### Annual reviews
Hold a review once a year, reflecting on the year's highlights and challenges.
This usually includes a salary review.
This may include setting goals or themes for the coming year.

[See more guidance on annual reviews](./annual_reviews.md)

### Promotions
Help your direct report make a case for being promoted.

### Help underperforming people
Help them understand where they are underperforming.
Help them plan to improve in these areas.
As a last resort, give notice of terminating employment.
