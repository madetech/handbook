# Promotions

This guidance is written for line managers. It'll help you understand how promotions work at Made Tech. 

You're responsible for supporting people you line manage when they want to get promoted.

## When should I look to promote someone?

It's difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but ultimately this decision is made when both you and the individual you line manage feel that individual is ready to take on the role they're to be promoted to in an active delivery team. A not exhaustive list of signs an individual may be ready includes:

- They exhibit some or all of the core competencies for their desired role
- They are consistently evidencing some or all attributes that are described in the SFIA level that corresponds to their desired role
- They have examples of exemplary work or feedback received
- They have received endorsement from the leads of their current project
- They display the potential to succeed in the desired role

## How do I seek promotion for someone?

The act of seeking a promotion is ultimately presenting the case for the individual to the Market Principal of their region.

You're asking the Market Principal to consider hiring this individual in the new role in their region, doing so can be influenced by a number of factors, including the state of the current contracted work in the region, ongoing hiring, budgets and more.

With this in mind, your goal is present a summary that achieves the following:
 - Demonstrates that the individual consistently showcases at least some of the attributes, competencies and behaviours required for the desired role
 - Demonstrates that the individual is a good fit for the role and upholds our core values
 - Demonstrates that the individual is committed to their own personal growth and progress, and gives and receives useful feedback
 - Tells an overall compelling narrative as to why the individual is ready to progress to a new role
 
## What is a promotion case and how do I create it?

The largest factor in compiling this case is documenting the evidence that shows the individual is ready to progress to the next role. The SFIA framework gives an excellent baseline for this - it will describe the desired attributes and behaviours for the role the individual wants to progress to. There is no set amount of evidence to gather for a promotion case, gather as much as you can, and remember it is ok if you cannot gather evidence for every single SFIA attribute.

Collating this evidence is something the individual should do themselves over a period of time, and evidence can take many forms, a non exhaustive list:
- Praise received from team or customers
- Constructive feedback received, and what decisions the individual has made since receiving the feedback
- Work done - screenshots, pull requests, code snippets, designs and diagrams. For non technical roles, outputs could take many forms, such as content written or research produced.
- Evidence of successful outcomes - a bid written that was shortlisted, for instance.
- Evidence of growth and learning - we can build a compelling narrative of growth even when things have gone wrong!
- 'Extra curricular' items - showcases or workshops done at learn tech, mentoring, volunteering, personal projects.
- Endorsements from project leadership

Collecting and compiling this evidence into a document is primarily the responsibility of the individual to be promoted, though you can help edit and format the document before adding your own additions:
 - Write an introduction to the document summarising the individual's progress since you began line managing them or their last promotion, whichever is applicable.
 - Conclude the document with your closing thoughts on why you agree that this individual is ready to take on their next role.

We recommend advising the individuals you line manage to collect and record this evidence over time regardless of actively seeking upcoming promotions, and that this isn't likely to be a purely objective experience, they are looking to sell themselves and that is a skill that can be developed and nurtured like any other.

## How do I formalise a promotion request?

When you and the individual seeking promotion feel they've gathered enough evidence and the document is ready, send an email to the Market Principal or their region that clearly outlines the role you are seeking for whom and the salary expectation you have attached to the promotion. Ensure your 'case document' is attached for reference.

You should arrange to present the document and talk through it with the Market Principal informally, to help them form a decision and answer any further questions they may have.

### What should I do if the promotion case is refused?

In the event the Market Principal declines to promote the individual, there will be reasons that they can fully articulate to you. In the case of behaviours or attributes the Market Principal needs further evidence of, you can take this back to the individual and formulate objectives with them in order to strengthen their promotion evidence.

There is no set period before you can revisit a promotion case, so it's recommended that in this situation you form a clear picture with the Market Principal as to what they need to see, so you can best support the individual to meet these expectations and progress.
