# Maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave

Whether you or your partner are having a baby, you're adopting a child or having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement, Made Tech encourages you to take leave so you can welcome the new child (or children!) into your family. Our paid parental leave is the same for all!

**Note:** You will have to have worked at Made Tech for at least 26 weeks at the point of the child/children's birth to be eligible for these benefits.

## Maternity and adoption leave

We provide 12 weeks maternity/adoption leave at full pay. [If you’re eligible](https://www.gov.uk/employers-maternity-pay-leave), you’ll get statutory pay for a further 39 weeks. You can take up to a total of 52 weeks.

For adoption leave, only one parent can take this type of leave. The other parent will need to take paternity leave or shared parental leave.

The breakdown of pay is:

- 12 weeks at 100% pay (from Made Tech)
- 6 weeks at 90% pay (statutory maternity/adoption pay)
- 33 weeks at £151.20 or 90% pay whichever is lower (statutory maternity/adoption pay)
- return to work on reduced hours (30 hours) for 4 weeks on full pay to phase back into full time work

See the detailed government guidelines: [www.gov.uk/employers-maternity-pay-leave](https://www.gov.uk/employers-maternity-pay-leave) and [https://www.gov.uk/employers-adoption-pay-leave](https://www.gov.uk/employers-adoption-pay-leave).

## Shared parental leave

We provide 12 weeks shared parental leave at full pay and up to 39 weeks at statutory pay.

The breakdown of pay is as follows if you qualify for SPL:

The rules around SPL are fairly complex. See the government guidelines: [https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay).

## Other Considerations

We offer a number of additional company benefits which may be attractive to new parents, including [remote/offsite working](../../benefits/remote_working.md), [a generous holiday allowance](../../benefits/taking_holiday.md), [flexible work weeks](../../benefits/flexible_working.md) and [flexible working hours](../../benefits/working_hours.md).

### Who do I need to inform about upcoming parental leave?

Please email people@madetech.com to request parental leave and include your child/children's due/adoption date. You should also inform your team lead so they can plan for your absence. The people team will inform scheduling if you are in a client facing team.

### When do I need to inform you about upcoming parental leave?

At least 15 weeks before the baby's due date. Find out more about [notice periods.](https://www.gov.uk/employers-maternity-pay-leave/notice-period)
