# Maternity, Paternity & Shared Parental Leave

Whether because you or your partner is having a baby, if you're adopting a child or having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement, Made Tech encourages you to take leave so that you can welcome the new child (or children!) into your family.
Our paid Parental Leave is the same for all! 

Note: You will have to be in employment with Made Tech for a minimum of 26 weeks to be eligible for these benefits.

We provide 12 weeks Maternity Leave at full pay followed by statutory pay for a further 26 weeks. You can take up to a total of 52 weeks.

The breakdown of pay is as follows:

## Other Considerations

We offer a number of additional company benefits which may be attractive to new parents, including [Remote Working](../../benefits/remote_working.md), [Untracked Holiday Allowance](../../benefits/flexible_holiday.md), [Flexible Work Weeks](../../benefits/flexible_working.md) and [Flexible Working Hours](../../benefits/working_hours.md). 

_Note: There is a strong desire to improve our offering, though we're currently constrained by our company size. As we grow and get a larger team and turnover, we're expecting to be able to make a more attractive package available_
