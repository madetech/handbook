# Parental Leave

Our current parental leave package is two weeks at full pay followed by statutory allowance.

In addition to this, we offer a number of benefits, including [Remote Working](benefits/remote_working.md) and [Untracked Holiday Allowance](benefits/untracked_holiday.md). We believe these benefits provide new parents with flexibility and allow them to achieve a good balance between work and family life. 

_Note: There is a strong desire to improve our parental leave offering. We're currently constrained by our company size, but as we grow and get a larger team and turnover, we're expecting to be able to make a more attractive package available._
