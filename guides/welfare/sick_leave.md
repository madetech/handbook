# Sick Leave

We're building a high-performance organisation that delivers great software products. We recognise that this requires a lot of hard work and that for our team to perform at the highest possible level, they need to be healthy in mind and body.

Often when we think of sickness we think of colds, stomach bugs, and perhaps even broken limbs. We don't think so much about sickness in the mind. As an organisation we want to challenge common thinking around this. We want you to feel okay taking a day when you feel down, when you're suffering from depression, after you've had a bad argument with a loved one and need some space to recover, or suffering from bereavement.

When people get sick we ask that they follow these guidelines:

* Don't be a martyr. If you're sick, take the time off. You should stay at home, don't come into the office and infect other people.

* We can provide support if you need help with your [state of mind](state_of_mind.md).

* If you need assistance with your sickness, you can use our [employee assistance programme](paid_counselling.md#employee-assistance).

* On your first day off, let your team know (Slack, email, etc.), or the operations team if you are on the Chalet, that you'll be away and what you had planned for that day. Aim to let them know as early as possible, by start of business, so they can factor your absence into their tasks for the day.

* Provide regular updates to your team, and an expected return date as soon as you have one.

* If you are taking four or more days sick leave, please supply a doctor's note.

* Record your sick leave in Kimble (as Absence) and in CharlieHR, for every day that you are on sick leave.

* The Account Team will have to report you as absent without reason to the People Team by 10:30 AM if we haven't heard from you. They will then get in touch, and if unable to get a hold of you, will call your emergency contact at 11:30 AM.

* If you accrue five or more days of sick leave annually, then the People Team will check in with you to find out how we can best support you. We want to ensure that we aren't putting you under too much pressure, and that you're not unhappy with your current role.
