# Sick Leave

We recognise that it requires a lot of hard work to perform at the highest possible level and our mental and physical wellbeing is an important foundation for this.

Beyond taking sick leave when you have a cold or flu we appreciate that you may need to take a day when you feel burned out or when you're impacted by  depression. Your Line Manager and the People team are here to help explore all your options when it comes to taking any type of leave and support you with your specific wellbeing needs so you can focus on getting better.

When people get sick we ask that they follow these guidelines:

* If you're sick and need to take time off to get well you will be supported by your Line Manager.

* We can provide support if you need help with your [state of mind](state_of_mind.md).

* If you need assistance with your sickness, you can use our [employee assistance programme](paid_counselling.md#employee-assistance).

* On your first day off, let your team know (Slack, email, etc.), or the operations team if you are on the Chalet, that you'll be away and what you had planned for that day. Aim to let them know as early as possible, by start of business, so they can factor your absence into their tasks for the day.

* Provide regular updates to your team, and an expected return date as soon as you have one.

* If you need to take several days of sick leave, you may need to provide a fit note from a healthcare professional. The number of days meets the current government guidance for employees [government guidance for employees](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-fit-note-a-guide-for-patients-and-employees).

* Record your sick leave on HiBob, for every day that you are on sick leave.

* The Account Team will have to report you as absent without reason to the People Team by 10:30 AM if we haven't heard from you. They will then get in touch, and if unable to get a hold of you, will call your emergency contact at 11:30 AM.

* On your return to work, we’ll ask that you complete a return to work form on HiBob to make sure you’re well enough to come back to work, and agree any support we can put in place

* If you accrue ten or more days or five occasions of sick leave annually, then your Line Manager will check in with you to find out how we can best support you. We want to ensure that we aren't putting you under too much pressure, and that you're not unhappy with your current role.

* If you accrue more than ten days of sick leave in a 12 month rolling period then this may be paid as Statutory Sick Pay. 
Please read our Absence Policy (available on our DMS) for full clarity on what’s available and processes supporting sickness absence.
