# Ethical Boundaries

We recognise that there may be certain types of customer, or certain types of industry that people feel uncomfortable working with or in.

At Made Tech nobody will be forced to work on a customer engagement in which they're not comfortable. If you feel this way about any recent customer wins or new engagements we're expecting to kick-off, please let it be known the Scheduling team so we can factor this in to any team shape planning.
