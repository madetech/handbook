# Ethical Boundaries

We recognise that there may on occasion be certain client accounts, or certain types of industry or project activity, that people feel uncomfortable working with - or in - for valid personal reasons.

At Made Tech nobody will be forced to work on a client engagement in which they're not comfortable. If you feel this way about any recent client wins or new engagements we're expecting to kick-off, please let it be known to the Scheduling team so we can factor this in to any team shape planning. If there are issues relating specifically to the client, we will also look to pick these up via other channels if appropriate.

Our [project assignment guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cgASgYU9rjF-y7pa9gJ9FJ8HCBP6M3ntmdgeLZclSPo/edit) will also help understand scenarios and situations where it is possibly to challenge a potential project placement.
