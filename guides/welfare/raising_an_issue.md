# Raising an Issue

From time to time people may have problems or concerns about their colleagues, customers, company leadership, work environment and so forth. We want everyone in the organisation to be empowered to raise an issue and have it dealt with swiftly and fairly.

## Have a conversation with the person involved

The first thing you can do, if you feel comfortable and able, is raise the issue directly with the person involved. This type of direct and informal approach is encouraged and we expect your colleagues who are approached responsibly to respond in a similar manner. This approach may be particularly appropriate to dealing with matters of speech and expression, where individuals may not be aware that their behaviour is causing distress.

## Raise the issue via your mentor

If you feel unable to have a conversation directly with the person involved, and they are a member of staff at Made Tech, then you can discuss this further with your mentor. They can help you find a way to discuss this directly with the person or discuss other routes to help resolve the issue.

In particular, if you have a grievance you feel unable to raise with your mentor and feel unable to raise directly, you should raise this issue with the people team who can help.

## Seek Third Party Advice

We provide staff access to a [employee wellbeing service](paid_counselling.md#employee-assistance) which includes a phone number you can call for third party advice on HR issues.

You can also call the [Acas](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=2042) on 0300 123 1100, Monday-Friday 8am-6pm.

## Mediation

At the time of writing we do not have anyone with mediation training at the company but if necessary we can bring in third party mediators to deal with disputes informally.

You can find out more about Mediation from [Acas](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1680).

If you wish to enter a mediation process, please ask the people team to request mediation.

## Formal Grievance Procedure

Grievances are concerns, problems or complaints that employees raise with their employer. We follow the Acas Code of Practice on Grievance Procedures.

If a grievance cannot be settled informally, the employee should raise it
formally with management, using the formal grievance procedure.

- Step 1: Employee should write a letter or email to the Head of People setting out the details of your grievance and how it might be resolved.
- Step 2: Made Tech will then arrange a formal meeting to discuss the issue as soon as possible. The employee has the right to bring a companion* with them. Made Tech may choose to adjourn the meeting to investigate the issue further.
- Step 3: Made Tech will then decide what action, if any, to take. The decision, and a full explanation of how the decision was reached, will be communicated to the employee, in writing, without unreasonable delay.
- Step 4: The employee then has the right to appeal any such decision. The appeal will be heard as quickly as possible, and efforts will be made to involve impartial members of staff or staff who have not already been a part of the grievance procedure. The outcome of the appeal will be communicated in writing.

\*Companion can include a paid official of a trade union, a lay trade union official that can provide evidence of experience in these matters, or a colleague. In certain circumstances we may also allow representatives from other organisations if particularly relevant to the grievance such as Citizens Advice Bureau.

The [Code of Practice](http://www.acas.org.uk/publications) can be found on the Acas website.

## Arbitration Tribunals and Civil Courts

If you cannot resolve your problem in the workplace, you may have the right to make a claim to an Industrial Tribunal or Fair Employment Tribunal.

You should seek advice from LRA before starting any procedure.

## Disciplinary Procedure
We always prefer to handle minor misdemeanours in an informal way, however in the event of misconduct at Made Tech, we follow a formal disciplinary (conduct) procedure detailed in our policy [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qIp6jGlUD726J4zJ8A-ZpOzxNw28EwZP/edit) 

This policy applies to misconduct and gross misconduct from our team members, and it includes what is and is not acceptable behaviour at Made Tech. 

We would always start the process with an investigation to understand what has happened, this could lead to a disciplinary meeting. The possible outcomes of a disciplinary meeting could be a warning or no further action. 

Should a team member’s actions be considered gross misconduct, this could then lead to suspension and/or dismissal. You would be given the right to appeal if you were given a warning or dismissed. 

If you are involved in or have been affected by a conduct procedure, you can reach out for support from: 

- The people team
- Our [Employee Assistance Programme](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/guides/welfare/paid_counselling.md#employee-assistance)
