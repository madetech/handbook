# DSE & Health & Safety Training

Made Tech has a legal duty to ensure the health, safety and welfare of everyone whilst at work. 
We want to make sure everyone can work productively and safely and understand where people might need other adjustments to do so. 
Our health, safety and well-being at work are important to how we deliver services to our communities and how we are treated at work so Made Tech asks that you complete DSE (display screen equipment) and H&S (health & safety) training.

You will receive an email link from IHASCO to complete the two training sessions. Each course will take approx 45 mins (including the assessment), 
but you donâ€™t have to do it all at once; you can start a course and return to it. 
However, we ask that you complete it within 30 days of starting at Made Tech.
