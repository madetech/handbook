# AI at Made Tech

## Start here!

This document serves as a landing page for anyone wanting to use AI tooling as part of their work at Made Tech.

The intent is for this page to serve as a starting point and top-level catalogue for anyone in Made Tech to discover and access all of the many projects and resources Made Tech has involving AI.

This is a community-lead effort - if you own or have knowledge about an AI-themed resource, `please` improve this page or add sub-pages so others can access it too!
