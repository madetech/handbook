# Eye Test Expenses

Everyone is able to claim back the costs of an annual eye test. You need to:

- Book the eye test yourself and get a receipt
- Submit the receipt for the eye test through Xero, using the category 'Staff Welfare'.

## Claiming for Lenses and Frames

If the outcome of the eye test is that you require glasses for the use of Display Screen Equipment (DSE) or (visual/video display unit (VDU), where an ordinary prescription is not suitable, then Made Tech will make a contribution towards the costs of a pair of glasses.

- Made Tech will pay for the lenses plus an additional Â£60 toward any frames that you choose.
- After you purchase your frames and lenses, submit the receipts through Xero.

Please request that the optician provides a report/copy of the prescription indicating these are required specifically for DSE or VDU use.

**Note:** If you use Westfield Health you may want to reclaim the cost using their service instead, especially if you wish to purchase more expensive frames.

If you have any questions on this please contact #ops
