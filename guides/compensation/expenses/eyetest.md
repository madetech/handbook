You can expense the cost of an annual Eye Test through Xero.

- Submit the receipt for the eye test through Xero

## Claiming for Lenses and Frames

If the outcome of the eye test is that you require glasses for the use of Display Screen Equipment (DSE), then Made Tech will also make a contribution towards the costs of a pair of glasses.

- Made Tech will pay for the lenses plus an additional Â£60 toward any frames that you choose.
- After you purchase your frames and lenses, submit the receipts through Xero.

**Note:** If you use Westfield Health you may want to reclaim the cost using their service instead, especially if you wish to purchase more expensive frames.
