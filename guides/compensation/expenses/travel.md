# Travel Expenses

If you incur travel expenses as part of your work at Made Tech, the business will reimburse your standard class travel costs.

Some examples of work travel you can expense:

- Public transport or taxi to a client site for a meeting
- Taxi home after working late
- Travelling to work at a client site outside of the region of your Made Tech office


## Using your own car

If it makes sense, you can use your car for travel reimbursed at the standard 45p per mile. Speak with your line-manager if you feel unsure. Please use something like google maps journey planner to get the round-trip distance and include a screenshot when claiming the expense.

If you have a petrol receipt (showing VAT) dated before the journey within a reasonable time, please take a photo of this together with your distance, which will let us claim the VAT back on the journey's petrol element. This is optional and the expense total should still be miles*45p.


## Travel that is not covered

Where you're employed as a staff member in a Made Tech office, your regular travel to that office or to a client site within that metropolitan area is not covered.

For example: if you're employed in the London office, and were working two days per week on-site with a client in Westminster, your travel from home to either the London office or the Westminster client site is not covered.
