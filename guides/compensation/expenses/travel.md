# Travel Expenses

If you incur travel expenses as part of your work at Made Tech, the business will reimburse your standard class travel costs.

Some examples of expensable work travel:

- Public transport / taxi to a client site for a meeting
- Taxi home after working late
- Travelling to work at a client site outside of the region of your Made Tech office


## Travel that is not covered

Where you're employed as a member of staff in a Made Tech office, your travel to that office or to a client site within that metropolitan area is not be covered.

For example: if you're employed in the London office, and were working two days per week on-site with a client in Westminster, your travel from home to either the London office, or the Westminster client site is not covered.
