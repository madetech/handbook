# Working From Home Expenses

Post- March 2020 most of us are now spending some or all of our working weeks at home or otherwise working remotely.

Where practical and safe, we encourage you to borrow equipment such as monitors, keyboards, and chairs from a Made Tech office to enable you to more effectively work at home. Made Tech will cover the cost of getting this equipment home.

Where this isn't possible, you may spend up to a total of Â£250 to purchase equipment to enable you to work effectively at home.

Some examples of things you may purchase:
- Monitor
- Keyboard
- Desk
- Laptop stand

Any equipment you purchase should be of a similar specification to that of the equipment provided in a Made Tech office (e.g. HD 27" monitor, wired keyboard etc.).

This equipment will remain the property of Made Tech and must be returned should you leave the business.

Where you have a specific occupational need that cannot be met within this budget, please speak with your Line Manager or the People Team who will ensure you have what you need to work safely and effectively.
