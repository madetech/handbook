#Salary & Pay Slips

We're paid on the 28th of the month, or the Friday before if the 28th falls on a weekend or during a bank holiday. Payroll is run by Mike Wheatley, who will issue payslips via email. You will require a password to open your payslips, which Mike can send to you (it's normally your NI number). 

If you've got a query on your salary amounts, please send these to finance@madetech.co.uk.
