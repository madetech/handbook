# Salary & Pay Slips

We're paid on the 28th of the month, or the Friday before if the 28th falls on a weekend or during a bank holiday. 

Payroll cut off usually falls on the 18th of the month and so if you started on or after that date, you would likely fall into the following month's pay run and recieve backpay for any period worked in the previous month. For example if you started on the 23rd January, your first pay day would be the 28th February and you would recieve pay from 23rd Jan - 28th Feb in that first pay check.

Our Finance team are responsible for payroll and you will receive an invite to register for our payslip provider just before your first pay day and then receive an e mail each month on pay day confirming when your pay slip is available.

If you've got any queries on your salary or payslip, please send these to finance@madetech.com
