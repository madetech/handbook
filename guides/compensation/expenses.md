# Expenses

There is now a fully documented Made Tech expenses policy which covers trains, travel, hotel accommodation, and reimbursement of other business expenses. As it is more detailed than the previous guidance, the policy has been changed to an internally facing document for now. [You can find the document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NthAC1xepzAI07o40c6WxXHbPttNxaCidhJ22eJHD-k/edit#).

There is additional information on [equipment to enable you to work from home](../../benefits/work_ready.md), and [eye tests](expenses/eyetest.md) on those pages.

## Travel
Made Tech is also now using TravelPerk to enable you to book all your business travel in one place. Payment is made directly by Finance so you don’t have to pay for travel yourself. For more information on when and how to use this take a look at the [TravelPerk document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12NiB2QxHZ5k8ajqP95fOo2I-GBKZQLuzQutKAiem0DQ/edit#) (internal link).

### Railcards
You can expense Railcards for the use of business travel. Made Tech will reimburse the price of any yearly railcard purchased from April 26th 2023 onwards. If you leave Made Tech you will not be charged for it and dont need to return it, but you cannot expense a railcard during your notice period.

To purchase and expense a railcard you need to;
- purchase a railcard
- add it to your TravelPerk account
- take a screenshot to show that it has been added
- share the image and receipt on Xero when expensing it back.

## How do you expense?

Expense claims need to be submitted via [Xero](https://login.xero.com/identity/user/login). If you don’t have a login please drop a message in #ops-finance or email [finance@madetech.com](mailto:finance@madetech.com).

There is more detail in the policy but all claims must be made within 90 days, and will typically be paid within 2 weeks.

There are also some approval processes in place:
- Normal expenses: Claims that align with the policy will be approved but any claims that are outside of the guidelines will need approval from your Head of Department.
- Account expenses: Expenses that are aligned to a specific delivery or account (e.g. client entertainment, travel to meetings, etc) should be agreed with the Delivery Manager and/or account team in advance. 
- Events and conferences: Expenses need to be approved in advance by the relevant Head of Department.

For all other information please read the policy document and send any questions to #ops-finance or [finance@madetech.com](mailto:finance@madetech.com).
