# Salary Reviews

Salaries are reviewed on an annual basis and are adjusted based on individual performance and market rates. We reserve the right not to increase salary at review and any increase in one year will not influence any future yearsâ€™ increase or set a precedent. 

Where your salary is changed part-way through a year, for example as a result of a promotion, your next annual review will be due on the anniversary of this salary change.
