# Salary Reviews

Salaries are reviewed in line with our pay review policy - once, each business financial year. They may be adjusted taking into consideration business performance, individual performance and market rates. We reserve the right not to increase salary at review. An increase one year does not set any precedent or influence any future reviews.

The other path to a salary adjustment is via our Internal mobility process (promotions or lateral moves) within the financial year.
