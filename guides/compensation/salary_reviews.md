# Salary Reviews

Salaries are reviewed in line with the organisation's pay review policy on an annual basis, aligned to the business financial year. They may be adjusted taking into consideration business performance, individual performance and market rates. We reserve the right not to increase salary at review and any increase in one year will not set any ongoing precedent or influence any future yearsâ€™ changes. 

As we have two promotion windows per year (autumn and spring), autumn promotion related salary uplifts will be applied from the 1st December. Spring promotion related salary uplifts will be applied from 1st June. 

## Promotions

In order to standardise and provide a fair evaluation of promotions, there are two promotion windows each year - April/May (spring) and October/November (autumn).
Team members seeking a promotion should discuss this with their line manager, complete a promotion pack and submit this to your manager in advance of the promotion window. More information can be found in our [Promotion Guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SU_vMpC2Bp3M1qLO6kvKwmyUN4GWjSnCnJVxrdLUv5U/edit).
A successful promotion will result in an uplift to the base of the new role's salary band or a 5% uplift, whichever is the greater.
Ordinarily, unless this is a lateral move or a move to an entirely new/different role, colleagues will not be eligible to apply for vacancies outside of the promotion windows - where there are exceptions to this, this will be clarified in the vacancy advert.
