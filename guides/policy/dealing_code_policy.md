# Dealing code

## Introduction
The purpose of this code is to ensure that the directors of Made Tech Group plc (the **Company**), and certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, do not abuse, and do not place themselves under suspicion of abusing, Inside Information and comply with their obligations under the Market Abuse Regulation as in force in the UK (and which applies to the Company as its shares are admitted to trading on AIM) and the AIM Rules. 

Part A of this code contains the Dealing clearance procedures which must be observed by the Company’s PDMRs and those employees who have been told that the clearance procedures apply to them. This means that there will be certain times when such persons cannot Deal in Company Securities.

Part B sets out certain additional obligations which only apply to PDMRs.

Failure by any person who is subject to this code to observe and comply with its requirements may result in disciplinary action. Depending on the circumstances, such non-compliance may also constitute a civil and/or criminal offence.

Schedule 1 sets out the meaning of capitalised words used in this code.

## Part A - Clearance procedures

1. **Inside Information**

   1.1. You cannot at any time tell anyone (including your family, friends and business acquaintances) any confidential information about the Company. In addition, if any information you have about the Company is Inside Information you cannot:
   
    >(A)deal in any Securities of the Company or any instruments linked to them;
    >
    >(B) recommend, encourage or induce somebody else to do the same; and/or  
    >
    >(C) disclose the Inside Information, except where you are required to do so as part of your employment or duties (you will know if this is the case).  
    
   1.2. This behaviour is known as “insider dealing”. The prohibition applies even if you will not profit from the dealing.
   
2. **Dealing By Restricted Persons**

   2.1. It is the Company’s policy that certain individuals from time to time be designated as a Restricted Person, because of their involvement in a particular transaction or business situation (for example, the annual results process) which means they may have access to Inside Information. You will be notified if you have been designated a Restricted Person and will also be notified when you are no longer a Restricted Person. If you are a PDMR you will always be considered a Restricted Person.
   
   2.2. The Board has absolute discretion to designate any employee as a Restricted Person, thereby restricting that employee from Dealing in securities of the Company, at any time. 
   
   2.3. A Restricted Person must not Deal in any Securities of the Company without obtaining clearance to Deal in advance in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Share Dealing Code.
   
   2.4. The definitions of ‘Dealing’ and ‘Securities’ of the Company are very broad and will capture nearly all transactions in the Company’s shares or debt instruments (or any derivatives or financial instruments, including phantom options) carried out by a Restricted Person, regardless of whether such transaction is carried out for the account of the Restricted Person or for the account of another person. 
   
3. **Clearance to Deal**

   3.1. You must not Deal for yourself or for anyone else, directly or indirectly, in Company Securities without obtaining clearance from the Company in advance.
   
   3.2. Applications for clearance to Deal must be made in writing and submitted to the Company Secretary using the form set out in Schedule 2, applications for clearance to Deal by the Company Secretary must be made in writing and submitted to the Chief Financial Officer.
   
   3.3. You must not submit an application for clearance to Deal if you are in possession of Inside Information. If you become aware that you are or may be in possession of Inside Information after you submit an application, you must inform the Company Secretary as soon as possible and you must refrain from Dealing (even if you have been given clearance).
   
   3.4. You will receive a written response to your application, normally within five working days. The Company will not normally give you reasons if you are refused permission to Deal. You must keep any refusal confidential and not discuss it with any other person.
   
   3.5. If you are given clearance, you must Deal as soon as possible and in any event within two working days of receiving clearance.
   
   3.6. Clearance to Deal may be given subject to conditions. Where this is the case, you must observe those conditions when Dealing.
   
   3.7. You must not enter into, amend or cancel a Trading Plan or an Investment Programme under which Company Securities may be purchased or sold unless clearance has been given to do so. 
   
   3.8. Different clearance procedures will apply where Dealing is being carried out by the Company in relation to an employee share plan (e.g. if the Company is making an option grant or share award to you, or shares are receivable on vesting under a long-term incentive plan). You will be notified separately of any arrangements for clearance if this applies to you.
   
   3.9. If you act as the trustee of a trust, you should speak to the Company Secretary, or designated director, about your obligations in respect of any Dealing in Company Securities carried out by the trustee(s) of that trust.
   
   3.10. You should seek further guidance from the Company Secretary, or designated director, before transacting in:
   
    >(A) units or shares in a collective investment undertaking (e.g. a UCITS or an Alternative Investment Fund) which holds, or might hold, Company Securities; or
    >
    >(D) financial instruments which provide exposure to a portfolio of assets which has, or may have, an exposure to Company Securities.

   This is the case even if you do not intend to transact in Company Securities by making the relevant investment.
   
4. **Further guidance**

    **If you are uncertain as to whether or not a particular transaction requires clearance, you must obtain guidance from the Company Secretary before carrying out that transaction.**

## Part B – Additional provisions for PDMRs

5. **Circumstances for refusal**

    You will not ordinarily be given clearance to Deal in Company Securities during any period when there exists any matter which constitutes Inside Information or during a Closed Period. The Company may also consider it appropriate to withhold clearance when there is sensitive information relating to the Company (e.g. the Company is in the early stages of a significant transaction but the existence of such transaction does not yet constitute Inside Information). 

6. **Notification of transactions**

   6.1. You must notify the Company and the FCA in writing of every Notifiable Transaction in Company Securities conducted for your account as follows:
    >(A) Notifications to the Company must be made using the template in Schedule 3 and sent to the Company Secretary, or designated director, by you or as soon as practicable and in any event within one business day of the transaction date. You should ensure that your investment managers (whether discretionary or not) notify you of any Notifiable Transactions conducted on your behalf promptly so as to allow you to notify the Company within this time frame.
    >
    >(E) Notifications to the FCA must be made within two working days of the transaction date electronically using the PDMR Notification Form on the FCA’s website <https://www.the-fca.org.uk/markets/ukla/regulatory-disclosures/mar-implementation>. If you would like, the Company Secretary can assist you with this notification, provided that you ask him to do so within one business day the transaction date.
    
   6.2. Once you have notified the Company of a Notifiable Transaction as required by 4.1(A), it will be required to make a market announcement of the Notifiable Transaction within two working days of the transaction date. The Company will use the information in the notification sent to the Company Secretary in order to release the relevant RNS.
   
   6.3. If you are uncertain as to whether or not a particular transaction is a Notifiable Transaction, you must obtain guidance from the Company Secretary, or designated director.
   
7. **PCAs and investment managers**

   7.1. You must provide the Company with a list of your PCAs and notify the Company promptly of any changes that need to be made to that list.
   
   7.2. You should ask your PCAs not to Deal (whether directly or through an investment manager) in Company Securities during Closed Periods and not to deal on considerations of a short-term nature. A sale of Company Securities which were acquired less than a year previously will be considered to be a Dealing of a short-term nature.
   
   7.3. Your PCAs are also required to notify the Company and the FCA electronically using the PDMR notification form on the FCA’s website <https://www.the-fca.org.uk/markets/ukla/regulatory-disclosures/mar-implementation>, within two working days of every Notifiable Transaction conducted by them or for their account. You should inform your PCAs in writing of this requirement and keep a copy; the Company Secretary (or designated director) will provide you with a letter that you can use to do this. If your PCAs would like, the Company Secretary (or designated director) can assist them with the notification to the FCA, provided that your PCA asks the Company Secretary (or designated director) to do so within one business day of the transaction date.
   
   7.4. You should ask your investment managers (whether or not discretionary) not to Deal in Company Securities on your behalf during Closed Periods.
