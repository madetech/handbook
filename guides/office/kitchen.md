# Kitchen Etiquette

We share the kitchen space with each other as well as with our customers. We have put together a few guidelines for keeping the kitchen nice and tidy.

While we donâ€™t have a designated employee solely responsible for restocking fridges and cupboards, if you see empty stock in fridges and cupboards, please use the overstock (labelled) to restock these areas. The Ops team try to keep on top of this, but some days can be busier than others, and we may not be in the following day. We want to try and ensure everyone is greeted with stocked drinks and snacks upon arrival.

## Coffee

We love our coffee at Made Tech. We have fresh beans regularly delivered to the office and have multiple thermos drip coffee jugs that keep coffee lovely and fresh. Please ensure:

 - When grinding beans that no meetings are going on in the meeting room as it's very loud and can interrupt voice calls and conversations
 - When you're done making coffee that you tidy up any spillages so the kitchen is left in a clean state

## Dirty glasses, cutlery, and crockery regime

We all appreciate a clean and orderly kitchen, and a clear sink. This is why everyone should put their dirty tableware in the dishwasher.

Before using the dishwasher, please familiarise yourself with [accepted dishwasher loading conventions](https://www.wikihow.life/Load-a-Dishwasher).

Please ensure:

 - When you're finished with any tableware that you rinse them and put them in the dishwasher
 - When the dishwasher is full, then load it with a cleaning agent and start it
 - When the dishwasher is running already, then wash your items in the sink with detergent instead
 - When the dishwasher has finished and has clean items in it, empty it. Then put your dirty items inside!

## Rubbish rules

We are passionate about recycling at Made Tech, please familiarise yourself with which items should be recycled on [First Mile's Dry Mixed Recycling](https://thefirstmile.co.uk/business-waste/collection/mixed-recycling) page.

When using the bins, there are a few things to keep in mind:

 - Put the right items in the right bins. Recycle!
 - When recycling, make sure your items are clean
 - Keep the bins clean, no one likes messy bins. When a bin accidentally gets dirty, wipe it down with some damp paper towels
 - When a bin is full, remove the bin liner and close it, then put in a new bag
