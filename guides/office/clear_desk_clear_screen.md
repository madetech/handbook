# Clear Desk/Clear Screen

Made Tech operates a Clear Desk/Clear Screen policy. This means that all sensitive/confidential materials should be removed from a user workspace and secured when no one is using it.

## Clear Desk:
- All ‘Confidential’ information must be hidden from view when not being actively used
- Hard copies should be kept in locked drawers or returned to the appropriate place in the office 
- Drawers/files containing sensitive information must be kept closed and locked. The keys to these drawers/files should be kept in a secure location and not left unattended at any time
- Printouts should be immediately removed from the printer
- When no longer needed, sensitive documents should be shredded in the office shredder
- Passwords to confidential material should not be left on pieces of paper, sticky notes, or left unattended on a desk

## Clear Screen:
- If you need to leave your workstation for any reason, you should ensure your screen is locked and not visible
- If you are using multiple screens, ensure you remain aware of what is displayed on both screens
- When working outside the Made Tech Office (either from home, onsite with a client, or in a public space) ensure you remain aware of your surroundings and who may be able to view your screen. 

### Devices:
- When not in use, turn off your device to ensure disk encryption is enabled.
- USB drives or other mass storage devices should be secured a locked drawer when not in use. Personal data (as defined in the Data Protection Act 2018) must not be stored on such storage devices

### Other:
- Confidential and restricted information should not be displayed on any whiteboards or sticky notes around the office
