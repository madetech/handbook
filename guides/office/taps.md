# Taps

## Changing a KeyKeg

1. Ensure the CO2 is off using the switch on the rear of the chiller unit
2. Disconnect the keykeg coupler: Grab the handle and pull upward, then rotate anti-clockwise
3. Disconnect the plastic hoses from the keykeg coupler: push the inner plastic ring toward the fitting, and simultaneously remove the plastic pipe.
  * Ensure you have a container to catch any stray liquids
4. Clean out the sink and fill with luke warm water. Add 4 capfulls of beer line cleaning fluid.
5. Fully immerse the keykeg coupler in the sink with the handle depressed (to open the valve)
6. Take the cleaning bottle, fill with 4 capfulls of beer line cleaning fluid and fill with water
7. Connect to the beer and air lines: Push the pipes into the fittings (then switch the compressor on)
8. Pull through the about 1/3 of the cleaning fluid, then leave for 20 mins
9. Pull through the remaining cleaning fluid
10. Disconnect cleaning bottle
11. Rinse out the cleaning bottle and replace with clean water.
12. Dispense all the clean water to flush the system
13. Disconnect the cleaning bottle and ensure the pipes are not under pressure, and the CO2 is off
14. Use the tap spanner to remove the tap from the front of the chiller.
15. Dismantle the tap fully: Unscrew the side flow adjuster, unscrew the front assembly nut, unscrew the tap handle. 
16. Place all tap parts fully immersed in the sink. Leave for 20 mins.
17. Rinse all parts under cold water and reassemble the tap
18. Refit the tap on the front of the chiller
19. Rinse the keykeg connector under the cold tap, with the handle depressed, also allow water to flow from the base through the top of the connector
19. Disconnect the cleaning keg connector: push the inner plastic ring toward the fitting, and simultaneously remove the plastic pipe.
20. Reconnect the keykeg connector to the plastic beer and air lines: Push the pipes into the fittings
21. Ensure the keykeg connector handle is in the raised position
22. Place the connector onto the top of the keykeg, rotate clockwise until it stops, then depress the handle (beer should flow into the pipe and crackling sounds will be heard from the bag shifting)
23. Enable the CO2 compressor and wait for it to stop.
24. Pull through about 1 pint of beer until it runs clear.
25. Enjoy.

## Friday
On a Friday, the drinks Taps need a small amount of work to mitigate the need for a full cleaning cycle in the following week.

Closing out on Friday steps:

1. Turn the black knob on the back fully counter-clockwise until it clicks (this is off)
2. Turn the tap flow control to the fully off position
3. Open the taps fully to clear through the last amount of beer (it is normal for the flow to not be reduced to 0%)
4. Use a sponge to remove any debris from the tap outlets
5. Cover the taps with a small amount of clingfilm
6. Leave the drip tray in the sink for the cleaner
