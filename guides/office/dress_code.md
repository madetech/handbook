# Dress Code

Made Tech is typically a casually dressed environment, however we have a need as an organisation to project a level of professionalism to each other, customers, potential hires, and other outside collaborators.

This should be considered a rough guide as to acceptable dress in the Made Tech office. If you're working on-site or visiting a customer organisation you should be sensitive to their dress code and modify your dress accordingly. If in doubt please seek advice from another member of the team.

## Generally not OK for the office:

- Tracksuit bottoms / sweatpants
- Sports-style shorts
