# Dress Code

Made Tech is typically a casually dressed environment, however, we should keep in mind that we remain a professional organisation.

This should be considered a rough guide as to acceptable dress in the Made Tech office. If you're working on-site or visiting a customer organisation you should be sensitive to their dress code and modify your dress accordingly. If in doubt please seek advice from another member of the team.

## Generally not OK for the office:

- Tracksuit bottoms / sweatpants
- Sports-style shorts
