# Office handbook

Each office has its own individual office handbook packed with information to help you understand areas such as 
access, meeting rooms and connecting to the internet.
Please take a look at the [main office handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1trOGW8mUDmMhDLLJxZwi194WkA6liFk1j0wiAu27C3Q/edit) 
(internal link) which holds general office information and links to the regional handbook for the office you are attached to. The office handbooks are also pinned to the top of the relevant office slack channel.

For any queries regarding offices please email [operations@madetech.com](mailto:operations@madetech.com) or get in contact via slack #ops

The floors are hardwood, they are fairly flat. 

The office is split over two floors. The office is all open space with one large and one small meeting room available on the second floor. The first floor has glass partitions but these do not exclude all office noise. Both floors can be quite noisy.

The kitchen is on the second floor, and access is through double doors made of glass. They are relatively light to open and open inwards and outwards. You can access snacks and cold drinks from lower cupboards, and some snacks are laid on the counter. Kettles and coffee machines are stored on the worktops. Mugs are stored in upper cupboards. The dishwasher is integrated into the lower cupboard units.

Most of the desks are adjustable with extension leads to plug into located on top of the desks.

The toilets are on the first floor. They are unisex, with four stalls and one shower.
