# Office handbook

Each office has its own individual office handbook packed with information to help you understand areas such as 
access, meeting rooms and connecting to the internet.
Please take a look at the [main office handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1trOGW8mUDmMhDLLJxZwi194WkA6liFk1j0wiAu27C3Q/edit) 
(internal link) which holds general office information and links to the regional handbook for the office you are attached to.
