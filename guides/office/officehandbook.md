# Office handbook

Each office has its own individual office handbook packed with information to help you understand areas such as 
access, meeting rooms and connecting to the internet.
Please take a look at the [main office handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1trOGW8mUDmMhDLLJxZwi194WkA6liFk1j0wiAu27C3Q/edit) 
(internal link) which holds general office information and links to the regional handbook for the office you are attached to. The office handbooks are also pinned to the top of the relevant office slack channel.

For any queries regarding offices please email [operations@madetech.com](mailto:operations@madetech.com) or get in contact via slack #ops

# How to book a desk

You can book a desk in any office using [Office RnD](https://hybrid.officernd.com/community/madetech/dashboard?date=2023-06-02). There is more information on how to book desks for yourself, your team and any visitors [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wCGrHN-prrUt8RnyNux2MshCTQ36D_rvTKTeu1qJwMk/edit) (internal link).

# Access information

Below is information on access and layout for each of our offices. If anyone has a disability that may require additional needs whilst in an office, please slack either #ops or email [operations@madetech.com](mailto:operations@madetech.com), and we will assist you with completing a PEEP.

# Office etiquette

Please leave desks and meeting rooms as you (should hopefully) find them. This means making sure all the equipment, including stationery, remotes, USB-C cables, keyboards, etc., are back where they should be. Chairs should be returned to the correct desk or room, and meeting room tables should be clear.
