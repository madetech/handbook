# Toilet Etiquette

Going to the toilet should not be something to be dreaded. New research from [The European Fecal Standards & Measurements Board](http://www.efsmi.org/) has shown that going to the toilet and being greeted by feces which register over one couric can cause long term damage to mental health.

No one is too good to put in some hard manual labour and clean the toilets when necessary. Let's keep the toilets sparkling clean, together.

## Toilet tenet

When using the toilets, please make sure you perform the following:

 - Flush the toilet after use, half flush if you can to save water (and the planet)
 - If any fecal matter remains inside the toilet bowl, please use the toilet brush to clean it
 - If the fecal matter is outside the toilet bowl, please seek medical attention
 - When using the toilet brush, always use the toilet cleaning liquid with it
 - Thoroughly rinse the toilet brush after using it
 - Let most of the water drip off the toilet brush before putting it back. Soaking wet toilet brushes can be a health hazard
 - Keep paper towels and toilet paper off the floor
 - Put toilet paper in the toilet and paper towels in the bin. Do not flush paper towels
 - Consider making use of air freshener after using the toilet if you think it is needed

### Wash your hands, your life depends on it

Germs can surive on bathroom surfaces for a long time. Human feces can carry nasty things like E. coli, Shigella, Streptococcus, hepatitis A and E, norovirus, and others.

Only around two thirds of people actually wash their hands after using the toilet. Think about that next time you're pair programming.

To keep it simple, follow the rule of "If you entered the toilet, wash your hands". Rinsing with water is not enough. Use soap, and lather it properly, then rinse it off.

Keep your hands clean, and keep Team Made Tech healthy.
