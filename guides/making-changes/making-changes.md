## Via github UI - best for small changes (single file)

1. Goto the github page: [Handbook](https://github.com/madetech/handbook)
2. Navigate to the file you wish to change
3. Click on the pencil button in the top right of the file view
4. Make the changes
5. Click commit changes
6. Enter a message to describe the changes - you can add more detail in the details box
   
   <img src="create_a_branch.png" width="300" />
7. As main is protected we need to create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
8. Enter a name for your [branch](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_branch.asp?remote=github) and click `Propose changes`
9.  Github will redirect to the `open pull request` page
    ![create a pr](create_a_pr.png)
10. Here you can describe your changes and click `Create pull request`
11. Once everything is green, you can get someone to review your changes and then click `Squash and merge`
