# Relocation



If you are planning to move address, youâ€™ll need to inform us as early as possible.


To inform us of an upcoming move, you'll need to let the following people know:

Your line manager -to inform them of any support you may need (booking leave to move house etc).
The People team via [people@madetech.com](mailto:people@madetech.com) - we need to know if we need to update your office location in bob and review if there are salary implications etc.
Your head(s) of - if a salary or location change is required, they may need to know in case this impacts your current or future projects.


Once you have confirmation of your new address and have spoken to the relevant people, youâ€™ll need to update this in your bob profile. 
You can do this via 'Actions > Employee Updates > Address Change'.
