- Ensure you are using `EAP-TTLS` as your method 
- For the `CA certificate`, there is no need to validate it so set it to **Don't validate**
- The **Identity** should be the local-part of your Made Tech email address 
  - For example, if your email address was `jsmith@madetech.com`, your username would be `jsmith`
- The **Password** should be the same as your [G Suite](http://gsuite.google.com) password

Before connecting, click on `Advanced`. Copy the configuration shown in the image below.
