# Android - WiFi Connection

When choosing to connect to a WiFi network, click on `Made Tech - Staff`. You will then be presented with a screen that looks something like the screen shown below.

Ensure you are using `EAP-TTLS` as your method. For the `CA certificate`, there is no need to validate it so set it to **Don't validate**. The **Idenity** should be the local-part of your Made Tech email address. For example, if your email address was `jsmith@madetech.com`, your username would be `jsmith`. The **Password** should be the same as your [G Suite](http://gsuite.google.com) password.

Before connecting, click on `Advanced`. Copy the configuration shown in the image below.

Select `PAP` for **Phase 2 authentication** and leave **Anonymous identity** as blank. Go back to the previous page and click **Connect**.

That is it! If you are experiencing any problems, please contact the ISMS team.
