# Slack

## Purpose of this guide

As of writing, we've grown to over 150 team members and we're also operating almost fully remotely. As such, Slack is one of our most important cross company tools and used extensively by everyone.
This guide is not intended to be a set of rules around using slack, this document is a guide to how we use slack. This should help everyone understand how to get the most out of slack while also being able to minimise distractions, notification noise and control their own focus time, without missing important updates from their team and the wider organisation.

# Profiles

[Filling in your profile](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile) helps people find and interact with you on slack, so it is important your profile has the following information:
 - Full name
 - A display name/handle that is discoverable, such as your first name
 - A picture (it doesn't have to be of you, but a clear view of your face is preferable.) This helps keep profiles easy to distinguish at a glance.
 - Your role/working group
 - Your office location
 - Your Made Tech email address
 
You can also optionally add the following useful information to your profile if you feel comfortable doing so:
 - A pronunciation guide for your name
 - Your preferred pronouns
 - Personal website, interests, hobbies
 - Emergency contact number


# Channels

Slack channels broadly fall under the following categories:-

 - Project channels (named after the project). If you are working on that delivery, it is expected you'll be in that channel, otherwise open project channels are optional.
 - Supply channels (prefixed `supply-`). These channels are used by groups focusing on how we _supply_ deliverables. Optional unless directly involved with this group.
 - Demand channels (prefixed `demand-`). These channels are used by groups focusing on how we engage with other organisations. Optional unless directly involved with this group.
 - Group channels (such as `ops-` or `academy-`). Channels used by operational groups, optional unless directly involved.
 - Specific purpose channels (usually prefixed with their temporary purpose, for example `bid-`). Temporary channels used for teams fulfilling a specific related task. Optional unless involved with the task, and will be archived after completion.
 - General channels (no prefix). Company wide chanels such as `announcements`, `help` or regional channels such as `manchester` and _community of practice_ channels prefixed with `cop-`, these channels are used for cross company communication and tend have channel specific usage expecations, which should be detailed in their channel topic.
 - Off topic channels (prefixed `x-`). These channels are entirely optional to join and use, feel free to create off topic channels if your interest or hobby is not yet represented!
 - Bot channels or 'firehose' channels. It is occasionally useful to setup bots that post information to specific channels periodically, it is advised that you only need to join these channels if you are involved in monitoring such information.

As of writing, it is expected every slack user will be present in `#announcements` (in fact, you cannot leave this default channel), this is so that everyone can be reached in case of an important announcement.
There are no other channels mandatory for _all_ users, but it is expected you will be in channels relevant to your working group.

## Private channels and group chats

Private channels can be used for specific tasks and group chats may be used to have small private discussions if necessary. It's worth noting that everything posted on our slack is logged and could be subject to a Freedom of Information request (specifically for channels relating to public sector projects), so it is wise to always use slack as if your message could be read.
 
# Notifications and Availability

We generally understand slack is an asyncronous tool - we do not expect immediate responses or constant availability.

The team you are working with will expect a level of availability, which can be at odds with reducing notification distractions and focus. We encourage teams to communicate openly and agree ways of working that suit the individuals and the task at hand, and we recommend utilising 'notification free' focus time and respecting focus time of others where possible.

# Threads

We encourage you to keep specific discussions in general channels to threads. Responding to a message by creating a thread reduces notification bloat for other users of the channel, and you will only be notified of further thread responses if you are participating in that discussion. You can 'follow' and 'unfollow' threads to further control notifications you receive.

# @ Usage

## @user
You use @user to get a specific user's attention in any channel where you'd like to ensure they get notified about something important.

## @here
Using @here will notify every user who is in the channel and active, for company wide mandatory channels this will usually be used to ensure important announcements are flagged. In other channels, feel free to use @here if you believe the post is immediately relevant to every user present. Some channels can get '@here noisy' such as `#help` where people are seeking to generate awareness, it is entirely reasonable to leave or mute such optional channels.

## @channel
Using @channel will notify everyone in the channel who is present, and bypasses some settings such as muting the channel. This is only used for messages of the utmost importance and should generaly be used sparingly.

# Conduct

Please remember to be courteous, polite and treat your colleagues with respect, and while off topic and non-work chat is encouraged, please remember to keep such chat work friendly!

# Emojis, bots, integrations

We have many custom emojis, feel free to add more and use them.

Many of our developers have built useful bots and integrations, such as the lunch group bot, donut time and the merit bot. Feel free to use these and develop your own, if you do so it is a good idea to present new additions in a company showcase!

Many teams find external integrations useful if working with other supported tools, from setting up CI/CD alerts to more esoteric functions. You may need to contact an administator for some additions, but generally you're free to add useful external integrations at your own discretion.
