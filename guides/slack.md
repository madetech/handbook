# Slack

## Purpose of this guide

As of writing, we've grown to over 150 team members and we're also operating almost fully remotely. As such, Slack is one of our most important cross company tools and used extensively by everyone.
This guide is not intended to be a set of rules around using slack, this document is a guide to how we use slack. This should help everyone understand how to get the most out of slack while also being able to minimise distractions, notification noise and control their own focus time, without missing important updates from their team and the wider organisation.

# Profiles

Please complete your profile fully on joining slack - this means a suitable profile picture (it does not have to be a picture of you, but a clear picture of your face is ideal), your full name and a representative display name.

You can optionally fill in the pronunciation guide for your name and add your preferred pronouns if you feel comfortable doing so.

Please also include your up to date email address and group/role, and the location you are based.

# Channels

Slack channels broadly fall under the following categories:-

 - Project channels (named after the project). If you are working on that delivery, it is expected you'll be in that channel, otherwise open project channels are optional.
 - Supply channels (prefixed `supply-`). These channels are used by groups focusing on how we _supply_ deliverables. Optional unless directly involved with this group.
 - Demand channels (prefixed `demand-`). These channels are used by groups focusing on how we engage with other organisations. Optional unless directly involved with this group.
 - Group channels (such as `ops-` or `academy-`). Channels used by 
 - Specific purpose channels (usually prefixed with their temporary purpose, for example `bid-`). Temporary channels used for teams fulfilling a specific related task. Optional unless involved with the task, and will be archived after completion.
 - General channels (no prefix). Company wide chanels such as `announcements`, `help` or regional channels such as `manchester` and _community of practice_ channels prefixed with `cop-`, these channels are used for cross company communication and tend have channel specific usage expecations, which should be detailed in their channel topic.
 - Off topic channels (prefixed `x-`). These channels are entirely optional to join and use, feel free to create off topic channels if your interest or hobby is not yet represented!
 - Bot channels or 'firehose' channels. It is occasionally useful to setup bots that post information to specific channels periodically, it is advised that you only need to join these channels if you are involved in monitoring such information.
 
## Mandatory channels

As of writing, it is expected every slack user will be present in `#announcements`, this is so that everyone can be reached in case of an important announcement.
There are no other channels mandatory for _all_ users, but it is expected you will be in channels relevant to your working group.

## Private channels and group chats

Private channels can be used for specific tasks and group chats may be used to have small private discussions if necessary. It's worth noting that everything posted on our slack is logged and could be subject to a Freedom of Information request (specifically for channels relating to public sector projects), so it is wise to always use slack as if your message could be read.
 
# Notifications and Threads
 
It's generally expected you'll be available in relevant, non-optional channels during working hours - this means project/group channels you're directly involved in and `#announcements`. When minimising notification noise, it's entirely reasonable for you to set availability with the teams you're working with. All other optional channels are exactly that, optional. It is also reasonable to mute slack entirely and check periodically, whatever works best for you, remembering that slack is the primary method of communication within the company while remote.

## Threads

We don't have a set etiquette regarding threads, though generally we try to keep specific discussions in general channels to threads. Some notable exceptions currently are `announcements`, and `help`, where threading posts is actively encouraged. Any channels with specifc threading (or other) requirements will describe this in the channel topic.

## @ Usage

### @user
You use @user to get a specific user's attention in any channel where you'd like to ensure they get notified about something important.

### @here
Using @here will notify every user who is in the channel and active, for company wide mandatory channels this will usually be used to ensure important announcements are flagged. In other channels, feel free to use @here if you believe the post is immediately relevant to every user present. Some channels can get '@here noisy' such as `#help` where people are seeking to generate awareness, it is entirely reasonable to leave or mute such optional channels.

### @channel
Using @channel will notify everyone in the channel who is present, and bypasses some settings such as muting the channel. This is only used for messages of the utmost importance and should generaly be used sparingly.

# Conduct

We have never outlined a specific set of rules of conduct and behaviour on slack as we have never needed to, please remember to be courteous, polite and treat your colleagues with respect, and while off topic and non-work chat is encouraged, please remember to keep such chat work friendly!

# Emojis, bots, integrations

We have many custom emojis, feel free to add more and use them.

Many of our developers have built useful bots and integrations, such as the lunch group bot, donut time and the merit bot. Feel free to use these and develop your own, if you do so it is a good idea to present new additions in a company showcase!

Many teams find external integrations useful if working with other supported tools, from setting up CI/CD alerts to more esoteric functions. You may need to contact an administator for some additions, but generally you're free to add useful external integrations at your own discretion.
