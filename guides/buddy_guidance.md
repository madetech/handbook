# Buddy Guidance

You've been chosen to be a buddy to a new team member - Yay. Here's some guidance to help you find out what's expected.

A buddy is a friend at Made Tech. Someone friendly who helps new team members connect and find their way, especially in their first 3 months with us when everything is new to them. 

Being a buddy is a really important way to help a new person integrate into Made Tech. 
When we're back in the office, you will show them all the good lunch places near the office, take them out for a coffee or lunch and help them find their way in the local area. 

As we're working remotely currently, most or all of your interactions will happen on video calls which we call 'coffee chats'.

## Buddies 
- proactively and frequently check in with a new starter to see how they are doing. In the first 3 months you may check in 2-3 times per month. After that time you can work out what suits you both, i.e. monthly catchup/remote lunch
- offer their help and answer all questions (or direct to the right person) 
- explain how things work here and where to find stuff
- are available to the new team member for any guidance and often just a chat
- are friendly and helpful humans who are here to welcome all our new team members
