# Mentees

## What to do once you're paired?

After your initial session, it will be your responsibility to create sessions with your mentor.

## Before the session

### Learning Style

Everybody learns differently, if you have an awareness of your learning style it might be worth sharing this information with your mentor as it may help them when pairing with you or suggesting resources to try in your own time. 

For example, if your learning style is visual you may prefer seeing diagrams when the mentor is explaining new concepts for the first time.

### Set Your Expectations

It might be beneficial to have a list or a mind map on the technical skills you would like to develop. You could try pair programming on coding katas (coding exercises) with your mentor instead. Codewars is a good place to sign up and start together.
