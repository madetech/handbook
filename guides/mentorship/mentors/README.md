# Mentors

Thank you for signing up to be a Made Tech mentor. Here’s a little guide for how to prepare and go about the sessions.

The point of doing this is to provide an opportunity for people to expand on their coding skills from professionals in the industry, but also to provide those looking to enter the industry with an insight into what it can be like.

As a mentor, you will be supporting people at various stages on their tech journeys, these could be people who applied to the Academy, or people who are members of various tech communities or networks. You get to help someone by sharing both your technical and non-technical knowledge and experience, helping them grow on their fundamentals or understand some tricky concepts.

## Mentor / Mentee Pairing

There are two ways that we will be pairing mentors with mentees

### Academy Support

Some people who have applied to the Academy will be allocated mentors. These will either be people who will be joining the next run of the Made Tech Academy, or who need more support for a future application.

### Availability and Skill Match

We may have people who get in contact either directly, or through external tech communities looking for support from a mentor with a particular skill. We will pair based on the skills they would like to develop.

When you are paired, we will give you the following information about the mentee in order to make contact.

- Name
- Email Address

Please contact your mentee via email, you and your mentee should arrange the time for your sessions.

## Booking the Sessions

Once you’re matched up, you will be put in touch with your mentee via email and on slack. If you don’t receive a message within a couple of days of the pairing being allocated, please let me know.

It could be useful to set up a [Calendly](https://calendly.com) account, and the mentee can use this to put time in your calendar.

Once the first session is arranged, you’re good to go!

## Your Sessions

How you conduct the sessions is up to you! As mentorship is currently done remotely, all you’ll need to do is join the hangouts/zoom link created in your calendar by Calendly.

The first session will likely be filled with introductions and discussions of expectations, but no doubt that you will both want to get coding pretty quickly. Feel free to find a plan that works for both you and your mentee.

## Mentoring Successfully

- Outline expectations and ground rules from the outset
- Ask the mentee their learning priorities, check that they’re on track
- Mutually set goals with your mentee
- Be clear about your contact schedule
- Hold each other accountable
