# Made Tech Mentorship Guide

At Made Tech, mentorship enables Made Tech staff with the opportunity to provide guidance and support to people in the wider tech community. Mentees are able to gain new knowledge and support and develop and enhance their skills.

## General Guidance

* Be kind, have empathy and be supportive
* Don’t share personal information about your mentee in open forums
* Please give at least 48 hours notice before moving or cancelling your session, so that both parties have a chance to adjust their schedules
* When first meeting, take some time to outline what goals you’d like to achieve, and how long it might take to achieve them. We recommend setting somewhere between 6 and 12 sessions and reviewing at the end to see where to go from there. 

## Mentee / Mentor Matching

Once you're matched up, we'll send an introductory email introducing you to your mentor.

## First session guidance

If you have a particular approach or mentorship / pairing style that you’d like to, please feel free to use it. Here are some suggestions to get the ball rolling on the first session:
1. Introduce yourselves
2. Outline goals and objectives
3. Discuss what you both would like out of the sessions - Set some [SMART Goals](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)
4. Discuss preferred pairing styles - It’s likely that you will be pairing during the sessions. We recommend using Visual Studio Code Live Share
5. Discuss how frequently you would like to have sessions 

## Before your sessions

Discuss what you will be pairing on during your sessions. In terms of what you could pair on, a good option would be to use some of the following:
