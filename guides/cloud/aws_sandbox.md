# Made Tech AWS Sandbox

## Overview

The Made Tech AWS Sandbox accounts are primarily used for individuals' personal development and testing. We run [AWS SSO](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/) to simplify and secure the IAM aspect of accessing this account.

Currently there are 2 accounts you can use:
- [Playground account](#playground-account)
- [Devops Pairing Interviews Account](#devops-pairing-interviews-account)

# Playground account

## Usage Policy

This AWS account should only be used for temporary short lived test type projects and resources are destroyed every Friday evening.

The Terraform and config for this cleanup task lives in this [aws-sandbox](https://github.com/madetech/aws-sandbox) GitHub repo.

## Security

The AWS Sandbox account is restricted by several service control policies blocking creation of IAM users, and is locked down to three regions (eu-west-1, eu-west-2 and us-east-1)

## Access

1. Request for a new user account in the #cop-cloud Slack channel in the `SandboxUsers` group.
2. AWS SSO login credentials will be emailed to you.
3. Follow the instructions and setup MFA.
4. Login via [https://madetech.awsapps.com/start/](https://madetech.awsapps.com/start/)

## CLI Usage

Use [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) to run CLI commands.

Reasons for using this tool can be found [here](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault#how-it-works).

1. Install [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault#installing)
2. Add the following config to your `~/.aws/config` file.

```
 [profile mt-playground]
 sso_start_url=https://madetech.awsapps.com/start
 sso_region=eu-west-2
 sso_account_id=261219435789
 sso_role_name=SandboxUsers
 output=json
 ```
 
 3. Test with `aws-vault exec mt-playground -- aws sts get-caller-identity`
 4. This pops open a browser where you need to login to create a session.
 5. Run any CLI based command in the same way e.g `aws-vault exec mt-playground -- terraform apply`

# Devops Pairing Interviews Account
This is a separate account for use in devops pairing exercises. 

This account differs in two ways from the main sandbox:
- It allows the creation of iam users. 
- It **deletes all resources inside it every day!**

## Access
Only employees that are conducting devops pairing interviews will be given access

1. Request your user account to be added to the `DevopsPairingInterviewer` group in the #cop-cloud Slack channel.
