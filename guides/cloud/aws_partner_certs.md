## Purpose of this guide

Made Tech are an [AWS Advanced Consulting Partner](https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/001E0000016ppWOIAY/Made%20Tech) and require all Made Tech employees to create a user account within the AWS Partner Portal as part of their onboarding process for a number of reasons.

 1. Access to free AWS Partner Training materials.
 2. Linking employees personal AWS Certification accounts to our Partner account.

# AWS Certification

As a Made Tech employee you will be encouraged and supported in taking AWS Certifications. You are advised to create your AWS Certification account using a personal email address so any AWS Certifications you achieve belong to you. This can be the same Amazon account login that you use for doing your shopping on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk), so you maybe already have an account!


AWS has an extensive Training and Certification framework, and there is a lot of great content we can utilise as an AWS Partner to develop and improve our knowledge when working with AWS services.

We aim for every Made Tech employee to achieve the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification, and the AWS Partner Portal provides some valuable free entry level training paths towards taking the Cloud Practitioner exam.
