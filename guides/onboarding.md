# Onboarding

## Before Your First Day

Once you’ve signed your contract, we’ll contact you about what you need to get ready for work. We’ll send you a laptop to your chosen address, and check that you’re all set up for working from home. 
We’ll start getting you approved to work in the public sector. This is called a Baseline Personnel Security Check (BPSS). We’ll arrange an online form to be sent to you by CBS Screening, and help you through the process.

It’s normal to have questions or worries - it’s okay to ask us to explain anything!


## Your first day

We currently run our onboarding remotely which means we can cover all our regions, as well as keeping people safe and well.

We will have set up your accounts and new Made Tech email address ahead of time.
You can use these to join your onboarding morning call. 
You’ll spend the morning with one of our Community Managers, who will introduce you to the wider team, and talk you through everything you need to know to be successful at Made Tech. 
Your onboarding will cover:
- All the accounts we use at Made Tech (Slack, Gsuite, CharlieHR etc.)
- A run through of how to use these (Timesheets, booking holiday..)
- And an overview of how we do things at Made Tech

This usually takes up the whole morning, and you’ll be handed over to your team for role specific onboarding, or an introduction to an internal team. 




## Group Onboarding 

In the first week of every month, we run a Group Onboarding week. This includes overview sessions of all the important things you need to know - plus a chance to meet some of the wider team.
During this week we cover some overviews on:

- People Team 
- Feedback Workshop
- Commercial 
- Public Sector 
- Delivery and Methodology 
- Marketing 
- Methodology Activity 
- Feedback Role Play Session
- Finance and Operations 

If you join during Group Onboarding week, we’ll likely start a little earlier than usual to get you set up with accounts before you join the rest of the team.
