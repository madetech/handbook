# Support Epics

Support Epic teams are composed of a pair of engineers. The Pair will typically deliver larger pieces of support work that range from half a day to a couple of weeks.

The [Support Epics Trello board](https://trello.com/b/fXZz8YC3/support-epics) shows the epics that are scheduled for commencement each week. You can assume the item at the top of the list is the current highest priority.

## Process Overview

Before starting a piece of work, it is the responsibility of the Pair to ensure that:

1. [ ] The epic that follows the epic you're about to start is planned in with the customer
2. [ ] You're aware of any time or budget constraints
3. [ ] There is a showcase booked no more than 2 days in to the epic
4. [ ] The customer is aware of what is needed of them
5. [ ] Record your time in Harvest in half-day increments
6. [ ] Keep the Customer Roadmap Trello board accurate

## 1. Planning the next Epic

Before starting the current piece of work, you'll want to ensure the next piece of work is planned in. This aims to solve a couple of challenges:

* If you hit an unexpected blocker on the current piece of work that can't easily be resolved, we're ready to pull the trigger on something else

* We ensure the customer for the next epic has some forewarning that they're going to be needed, and that we've got everything we need to get moving on that epic as soon as we're able.

To complete planning, you should ensure that:

- [ ] You've had a spoken conversation with the customer
- [ ] You've [Popped the Why Stack](http://www.mattblodgett.com/2009/01/pop-stack.html) to ensure you understand what commercial goal the customer is trying to solve
- [ ] You've created a new Trello board for that epic of work, breaking down the high level deliverables
- [ ] You've given the customer an indication of when we're planning to kick off that piece of work
- [ ] You've given the customer an indication of when the first showcase for that piece of work will happen
- [ ] You have everything you need to kick off and complete that work to your current understanding

## 2. You're aware of constraints

Often customers may have limited hours left in their support allowance for the current month, they may only be willing to invest a set number of hours to achieve a particular goal, or they may be working to a particular timescale.

- [ ] You've had an internal or external conversation to make yourself aware of time or budget constraints

## 3. Showcase at least every 2 days

We want to make sure we're solving the right problem. We want to talk to customers as often as possible to ensure we're on the right course. At an absolute maximum, you should showcase to the customer every 2 days.

- [ ] Throughout the delivery you're never more than 2 days away from a showcase with the customer

## 4. The customer knows what's needed of them

To be able to move fast, we need to ensure we've got the information we need, and that we'll have access to the customer to answer questions that may arise during delivery.

- [ ] We have the information we need from the customer to be able to start the epic
- [ ] We've set expectations of the customer as to how often we expect to need access to them
- [ ] We're aware of when during the delivery the customer is likely to be un-contactable

## 5. Record your time in Harvest

We bill support customers based on the hours we spend delivering for them. It's really important timesheets are up to date, as we send regular emails to customers showing how many hours they have remaining for the month. Timely information is key for customers to use this for decision making.

- [ ] You're recording your time in Harvest at least once per day for the duration of the delivery

## 6. Update the Customer Roadmap Trello

We use the roadmap Trello boards for a couple of purposes:

* During the support call with customers to prioritise workload.

* In sending a wider digest email to the customer team to share our progress and the value we've recently delivered for them.

For this reason, it's really important that the ticket is in the relevant column in the Trello board, and that the description reflects the current state of play. The description is included in the digest email.

Example descriptions:

Before starting:
> For items that appear out of stock, ensure they can't be ordered. Capture customer emails so we can let them know when it's back in stock.

After completing:
> Derek and Mavis added a feature to prevent customers ordering out of stock items. Additionally, they provided the ability to email customers who ask for out of stock alerts.

- [ ] The Customer Roadmap always accurately reflects the current state of play
