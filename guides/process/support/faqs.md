# Support FAQs

## When should I mark as pending versus closed?

Pending is for when waiting for a reply which is needed to progress. Closed is for when an issue is resolved/backlogged. Often a user will reply to the final message - this can just be closed unless it requires further action to be taken.

## Who replies to customers, should it be same person or just whoever is on triage that day?

In most cases whoever is on triage that day: outstanding triage work should be handed over from day to day. Occasionally specific domain knowledge may be required in which case it may be easier/more appropriate for that person to respond instead.

## Who does larger quotations/estimation of work that is requested via groove?

Ideally whoever is triage, but not everyone has the context of the project to be able to do it, so probably dependent on case. Ask if you're unsure.

## If a Trello ticket is created via slack rather than groove, how do we update customer when task is complete? Groove?

Generally if someone raises an issue on Slack they should be encouraged to send it into Groove so that it doesn't get lost. If it's literally a 5 minute job though this might not be necessary and issue can be responded to/closed out via Slack.

## How do I communicate with customer about ticket?

This is dependant on where the issue is in workflow:
 * New issue still open in Groove: all communication ideally to be done via Groove
 * Issue has been backlogged but not scheduled/started: via Trello comments on the card in the first instance. Or via Slack/email
 * Issue is in progress: via Slack or email

## What's expected are there around showcases?

Doesn't necessarily need to be demoing working software but should be at stages that will facilitate useful conversations with stakeholders. We should be showcasing at least with colleagues if not customer stakeholders every 2 days.

Software showcases of completed work should be scheduled with customers at least weekly, where we plan to show some sort of finished product. Even if the whole feature is not complete, the parts that are should be production ready.

## How should we estimate deadlines?

Unless we can be very sure that our estimations will be correct, it's best not to give one. Rather it's much safer to look at a body of work, work out the tasks involved, and if the first slice is a known quantity, commit to that unit first. Once this has been delivered there will be a better understanding of a piece of work and the complexity involved. If possible, commit to the next smallest chunk. If each chunk are likely to be the same amount of work, you can after two or three chunks start predicting the likelihood of the time each remaining chunk will take.

## When planning support work what is the definition of "reasonable"? A top-down approach or a bottom-up approach?

Generally speaking it will be a little of both. For a support pair the commitment maybe something like 'work towards objective X'. It's the responsibility of the individual pair to negotiate and communicate with the customer what an achievable slice towards this objective is for the upcoming week.
