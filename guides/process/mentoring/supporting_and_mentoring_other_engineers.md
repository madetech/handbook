# Supporting and Mentoring other Engineers

## Constructivist Learning Theory

> Constructivist teaching is based on the belief that learning occurs as learners are actively involved in a process of meaning and knowledge construction as opposed to passively receiving information. Learners are the makers of meaning and knowledge.

Our experience in mentoring and coaching has shown us we gain the most knowledge and understanding not through simply providing answers and solutions to questions or problems but instead by helping provide tools and information through which others can shape their own answers. We can often help another engineer when they ask a question by asking further questions to help frame thinking or providing potential sources of information that will provide further guidance to them.

## Responding to questions

When a colleague asks a question it's important that we try our best to make them feel listened to and understood, if they are new to this process it's probably worth explaining why we aren't directly answering their request. Explain the value we place on helping others to find the tools to solve their own problems rather than solving/answering directly for them

### Clarifying the question

Does the person asking the question have all the tools to adequately clarify the problem they are facing? If they can't it's probably best trying to guide them towards being able to better frame the problem they're facing and developing language around it.

If they have the language but are struggling to explain the root cause you can try applying [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) as a method of helping them focus in on it.

### Guidance and leading over Answers

Where possible when asked a question the best possible response is either a prompt or question that will help the learner explore their situation deeper without feeling they've been spoon fed or simply given a solution.

We value providing others the tools to assemble their own learnings, to help with this we should phrase questions in a way that allows for open discussion and prompts consideration on the topic we're dealing with. Avoiding providing solutions or responding with closed Answers/Questions can shut down the ability for the asker to form their own understandings and views on the problem they are facing.

### Sources of information

Does the learner know the best place to look for information that could help answer their question? Do they know the correct terms to find this if they were to [Google it](#google-it)? If they don't, guide them towards some good resources you know or if you're both struggling to find something that helps provide further understanding throw it out to the team via the #slack-overflow channel in our slack.

It's worth bearing in mind where possible that providing multiple types of resources (video, audio, text, workshop) is potentially the most beneficial way to accommodate people with disparate learning styles.

In the [Academy Workshops repo](https://github.com/madetech/academy-workshops) you can find a variety of workshops that we have worked on and peer reviewed that can help provide resources or even questions/discussion topics that can be used with learners.

### Pair on it

Pairing can also be an effective method of helping a colleague with a question, it's important that we remember the aim is to help them develop a solution for themselves so this may involve taking more time in the navigation role than you would normally with pairing. Prompt them to discuss their thinking and what potential solutions they think there are as they go, if they are struggling with this work with them to break it down into smaller chunks and get them to build a plan for tackling these chunks (This can be done on paper or with pseudo-code, it's more about the thought process really).

Even if you're not driving it's important to maintain pairing discipline; asking questions and sticking to breaks and timers.

### Training behaviours

Where necessary or valuable we should look at improving a Developer Behaviour like one of the [XP values](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html)

### Training skills

Sometimes it will be necessary to help the learner develop a skill based on how they ask their question. If they are struggling to clarify the problem their facing they may need help working on their debugging skills. When we do this we may take a more closed approach the first time (as the learner may need more of a walkthrough) but in future situations the learner should require less explicit support.

### Open questions


> Open questions have the following characteristics:
> - They ask the respondent to think and reflect.
> - They will give you opinions and feelings.
> - They hand control of the conversation to the respondent.

When working on mentoring a colleague we want to have discussions around our aims and the questions/problems they are facing. By using open questions we can try and provoke these discussions instead of allowing simple yes or no answers.

### Google it

Googling the problem can sometimes be the best way to highlight to a learner that it's not required to have an exhaustive knowledge of all the documentation around a subject, once you've made them feel listened to suggest this approach to them. If they are struggling to clarify the problem enough you should try and work on this with them first.

### Solving their problem

Sometimes a problem will be tricky enough that trying to provide guidance can take significantly longer time than you can fully devote to a mentee, in these rare instances it's ok to help provide a solution but you should talk through it with them as you go and try to ensure they've understood it.
