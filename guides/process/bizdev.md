# Business Development

If you're holding the Business Development mantle, there are a handful of chores you'll likely be undertaking on a regular basis.


## Twitterers (every couple of days)

Check the [suspects](https://twitter.com/madetech/lists/suspects) every couple of days and see if there's an obvious angle to open a friendly conversation.

### Keeping the list fresh

Based on our current business development goals, you might want to consider ensuring we've got the most relevant people on this list about once per month.


## Monthly mailings (closest Thursday to 8th of the month)

Pull together some of our most relevant blog content, or indeed, other relevant content you think is particularly pertinent and get both the `less technical` and `technical` mailings out.

In addition, you want to ensure that relationship-holders in the business are personally sending out a piece of our content to people we're having active conversations with.


## Booking meetings (weekly)

Check the Hubspot calendar to see if we're due to get in touch with any of our regulat contacts. Coerce the relationship owner to get in touch. Ensure relationship owners are lining up the reminder for the next meeting thereafter.


## Government

You should make sure you're subscribed to receive [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities) notifications.

Check the working locations of the opportunities to ensure they're not being delivered exclusively from client-sites way out of town. Be aware that opportunities posted will almost certainly be subject to tender.


## Segmenting leads

When a lead gets in touch with us via the website, by calling in, or email, if you perceive them to be a potential lead, you should add them to our [Master Contact list](https://madetech.createsend.com/subscribers/listDetail.aspx?listID=986BB7E62AE1EC90).

Using tools such as LinkedIn, find out what you can about their job role and company, and based on what they contacted us about, use this to populate their profile in Campaign Monitor, particularly:

- Source
- Interests
- Persona
- Lifecycle stage
- Sector
