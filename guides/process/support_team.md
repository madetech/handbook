# The Made Tech Support Team

## High level overview

Our Support Team is best thought of as the 'on-demand' equivalent to our AaaS offering. They undertake smaller tactical pieces of work which normally would necessitate the spinning up of a dedicated Sprint team. The length of work undertaken varies from less than an hour, up to about a month. Beyond that our AaaS offering becomes more appropriate. 

## Support Team Structure

The support team doesn't have a fixed roster of staff and instead consists of a number of developers based availibility of staff and customer demand for support work. The support team is formed of:
 * The **'Triage Team'**, a core rota of staff each contributing a day or more of their week to oversee intake of new issues, and fixing small and critical issues
 * A variable number of **'Support Pairs'**. These pairs are stable from week to week, and generally have an overarching goal which spans many weeks

## Support issue lifecycle

All support issues begin life as an email into support@madetech.com. These are forwarded automatically into our GrooveHQ inbox to be sorted by the Triage Team. We aim to resolve all new issues within 48 hours with one of the following resolutions:
* Fix issue if it can be done so in < 2 hours
* Fix issue if it is causing significant business impact to customer
* If it is a larger piece of work, and/or non-urgent then it should be moved to the customer's backlog in Trello, where it can be prioritised against other work, and potentially scheduled in for a Support Pair to complete

Each Customer has their own Trello board for prioritising work. Issues are grouped differently for each customer but each board has the following 3 columns:
1. 'New Issues' this is anything that's been backlogged from a Groove issue
2. 'Up next' issues will be automatically copied to our Support Epics board where they can be scheduled and assigned
3. 'Recently Completed' issues are things which have been completed in the last week or so

## Support Planning

During a weekly call (bi-weekly for some) our client will agree to a commitment of work to be completed the following week by the support team. These issues will be moved to the 'Up Next' column, and copied to the Support Epics board.

By Thursday of each week the Support Epics board will have:
 * A list of items that can be reasonably completed by support pairs in the upcoming week, and have a pair assigned to them
 * A list of 'Triage Team' items, which can reasonably be completed by memebers of the Triage Team around core Triage work

## Working in a Support Pair

If you're on a Support Pair then it is your responsibility to:
 * Ensure you know at the start of each week what your pair will be working on, and have a goal in mind for the Scrum of Scrums
 * Book in at least one showcase with the customer that week so they can see what progress has been made towards the goal
 * At the end of each day record your time in Harvest against the relevant customer. You should also include a brief description of the work carried out
 * Communicate regularly with the customer especially around deployments so they can plan any testing they may want to do

## Working in Team Triage

If you're working on Team Triage then it is your responsibility to:
 * Know which days you are on Triage duty, and swap days in advance if you're unable to
 * Work towards the Triage goal of resolving everything within 48 hours (NB. Backlogging an issue is an accepted resolution)
 * Call for help from others if there is more triage work than you can resonably handle
 * Record all time spent in Harvest against the respective customers
 * Handover any incomplete issues to whoever is on Triage the following day

## Support Team FAQ

### When should I mark as pending versus closed?

Pending is for when waiting for a reply which is needed to progress. Closed is for when an issue is resolved/backlogged. Often a user will reply to the final message - this can just be closed unless it requires further action to be taken.

### Who replies to customers, should it be same person or just whoever is on triage that day?

In most cases whoever is on triage that day: outstanding triage work should be handed over from day to day. Occasionally specific domain knowledge may be required in which case it may be easier/more appropriate for that person to respond instead.

### Who does larger quotations/estimation of work that is requested via groove?

Ideally whoever is triage, but not everyone has the context of the project to be able to do it, so probably dependent on case. Ask if you're unsure.

### If a trello ticket is created via slack rather than groove, how do we update customer when task is complete? Groove?

Generally if someone raises an issue on Slack they should be encouraged to send it into Groove so that it doesn't get lost. If it's literally a 5 minute job though this might not be necessary and issue can be responded to/closed out via Slack.

### How do I communicate with customer about ticket?

This is dependant on where the issue is in workflow:
 * New issue still open in Groove: all communication ideally to be done via Groove
 * Issue has been backlogged but not scheduled/started: via Trello comments on the card in the first instance. Or via Slack/email
 * Issue is in progress: via Slack or email

### What's expected are there around showcases?

Doesn't necessarily need to be demoing working software but should be at stages that will facilitate useful conversations with stakeholders. We should be showcasing at least with colleagues if not customer stakeholders every 2 days.

Software showcases of completed work should be scheduled with customers at least weekly, where we plan to show some sort of finished product. Even if the whole feature is not complete, the parts that are should be production ready.

### How should we estimate deadlines?

Unless we can be very sure that our estimations will be correct, it's best not to give one. Rather its much safer to look at a body of work, work out the tasks involved, and if the first slice is a known quantity, commit to that unit first. Once this has been delivered there will be a better understanding of a piece of work and the complexity involved. If possible, commit to the next smallest chunk. If each chunk are likely to be the same amount of work, you can after two or three chunks start predicting the likelihood of the time each remaining chunk will take.

### When planning support work what is the definition of "reasonable"? A top-down approach or a bottom-up approach?

Generally speaking it will be a little of both. For a support pair the commitment maybe something like 'work towards objective X'. It's the responsibility of the individual pair to negotiate and communicate with the customer what an achievable slice towards this objective is for the upcoming week.

### How do we ensure that the Triage Team pulling in more resources in times of need won't have a negative impact on other customer goals?

This is up to each individual - if you don't feel that you can assist without impacting your goal for the week then you should probably not volunteer to help. Triage Team members tend to be people with fairly variable commitments week to week so hopefully one or another should have some slack to help out.
