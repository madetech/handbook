# How to timesheet

## General

We use [Kimble](https://www.kimbleapps.com/) to complete timesheets. All resources on how to complete and approve timesheets are in the [Knowledge base](https://sites.google.com/madetech.com/signpost/home/kimble-resources?authuser=0) (including a link for login through Single Sign-On (SSO). 

Made Tech hours are 35 per week, 7 hours per day full time. Part-time hours are prorated according to your agreed hours.

Only billable team members need to complete a timesheet (including contractors) and you will be notified at your onboarding session if you need to complete one. The timesheet must be completed to account for all of your time in the working week (excluding contractors).

Timesheets are approved by your Delivery Manager or Project lead for client work (including non-billable projects), and Operations or service area lead for internal projects such as Sales or Marketing.

Any absences i.e. Holiday, Medical leave, etc still need to be recorded in the People Team system (currently CharlieHR).

## When to submit your time

Time sheets need to be submitted weekly **every Friday by 12pm** and we use the data to directly invoice our clients.

When the end of the month falls on a weekday other than Friday, you will be asked to submit a timesheet up until the end of the month. This will be in addition to the Friday timesheet meaning you need to complete 2 in a week.

E.g. June 30 falls on a Tuesday, your timesheet needs to be submitted up until Tuesday i.e. 7 hours for Monday and 7 hours for Tuesday. The rest of the week (Wednesday to Friday) will be included in the Friday timesheet.

## What categories should I allocate my time to?

All of your 35 hours should be allocated to the category/ies where you spend your time. This will either be a client project or an internal project or a combination of both.

## Client projects

Client projects are separated into 3 categories; Billed, Investment and Chalet, you will be allocated to one as appropriate by the Scheduling team.

Billed is where we are charging the client for your time and indicated by a ‘BIL’ in the project title.

Investment is where we are investing time with the client but not charging them for your time, you are available should another suitable billed opportunity come up. This is indicated by a ‘INV’ in the project title.

Chalet is where you are not assigned to a client and are completely available for billed opportunities and internal projects. This is indicated by a ‘BEN’ in the project title.

## Made Tech internal projects

You may be on an internal project full time or in conjunction with a client project.

You should allocate your time to a project when you’ve spent 2 hours or more.

## How to submit your timesheet

We use Kimble to complete timesheets. All resources on how to complete and approve timesheets are in the [Knowledge base](https://sites.google.com/madetech.com/signpost/home/kimble-resources?authuser=0).

## Timesheet approval process

Once a team member has submitted their timesheet on Friday by 12pm, Delivery Managers and Service Area owners need to [approve their team's timesheets](https://trello.com/c/k12r2uja/40-approving-timesheets) by 1pm.

### Why we need to approve timesheets

Timesheet data directly drives our client invoicing, so it’s important it’s accurate and complete at the end of every week. It will also save you time when checking invoice accuracy at the end of the month. When approving timesheets for the week we need to:
* Check your team has completed their timesheet in full; and has accurately recorded the time they spent on the project (inc. absences like illness and holidays)
* Account for any differences between the team’s forecast time and their actual time spent and report this to the Operations team

The review and approval process should take 5-10 minutes; and picking up any errors or unexplained differences saves the business a lot of time!

We also ask that if you are going on holiday, that you allocate it to another Delivery Manager or senior member of the team. Scheduling can change this in Kimble, and change it back to you when you return.
