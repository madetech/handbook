# How to timesheet

## General

We use [Kimble](https://www.kimbleapps.com/) to complete timesheets. All resources on how to complete and approve timesheets are in the [Knowledge base](https://sites.google.com/madetech.com/signpost/home/kimble-resources?authuser=0) (including a link for login through Single Sign-On (SSO). 

Made Tech hours are 35 per week, 7 hours per day full time. Part-time hours are prorated according to your agreed hours.

Only billable team members need to complete a timesheet (including contractors) and you will be notified at your onboarding session if you need to complete one. The timesheet must be completed to account for all of your time in the working week (excluding contractors).

Timesheets are approved by your Delivery Manager or Project lead for client work (including non-billable projects), and Operations or service area lead for internal projects such as Sales or Marketing.

Any absences i.e. Holiday, Medical leave, etc still need to be recorded in the People Team system (currently HiBob).

## When to submit your time

Time sheets need to be submitted weekly **every Friday by 12pm** and we use the data to directly invoice our clients.

When the end of the month falls on a weekday other than Friday, you will be asked to submit a timesheet up until the end of the month. This will be in addition to the Friday timesheet meaning you need to complete 2 in a week.

E.g. June 30 falls on a Tuesday, your timesheet needs to be submitted up until Tuesday i.e. 7 hours for Monday and 7 hours for Tuesday. The rest of the week (Wednesday to Friday) will be included in the Friday timesheet.

## What categories should I allocate my time to?

All of your 35 hours should be allocated to the category/ies where you spend your time. This will either be a client project or an internal project or a combination of both.

## Client projects

Client projects are separated into 3 categories; Billed, Investment and Chalet, you will be allocated to one as appropriate by the Scheduling team.

Billed is where we are charging the client for your time and indicated by a ‘BIL’ in the project title.

Investment is where we are investing time with the client but not charging them for your time, you are available should another suitable billed opportunity come up. This is indicated by a ‘INV’ in the project title.

Chalet is where you are not assigned to a client and are completely available for billed opportunities and internal projects. This is indicated by a ‘BEN’ in the project title.

## Made Tech internal projects

You may be asked to support internal Made Tech initiatives while on a billed engagement. This includes activities such as hiring, bid writing, helping with our academy, or supporting one of our service areas.

Where these commitments total less than 5 hours per week, they should be included in our standard operating overhead and should not be accounted for separately from billed hours.

Some internal activities do not count towards the 5 hours as our clients benefit from them indirectly. These include:

* Line management (1:1s etc.)
* Taking part in communities of practice

When the total internal commitment exceeds 5 hours in a week the 5 hour rule no longer applies, so each commitment should be allocated in its entirety to the appropriate project in Kimble and not included in billable hours.

Please ensure that you get approval in advance from your account team for all non-delivery commitments. You must also get agreement from the relevant service area leader before booking any time against their service area project.

### Why we need you to do timesheets

Timesheet data directly drives our client invoicing. Incomplete and incorrect timesheets can lead to us under or overcharging clients which can create significant challenges for account and finance teams.

Timesheet data also creates wider business-critical data about utilisation, client investments and time spent on other activities that's needed for reporting and planning.

### Why we need you to do timesheets weekly
Whilst we invoice our clients monthly it's vitally important that the data driving these invoices is accurate at a week by week level. Many clients do check the individual items driving an invoice to validate that they've been correctly charged by us. Weekly timesheets ensure we capture time spent while it's fresh in our memories.

Doing them weekly provides immediate visibility of time spent for line and delivery managers to create better quality project level conversations about time spent and weekly-level understanding of budget burn-down for client conversations. This allows us to update our monthly revenue forecast in real time: helping us understand whether we're on course to meet projected income due to things like sick leave, or last minute changes to time allocation, and readjust targets and cashflow forecasts as we go.

It’s important that the data is accurate and complete at the end of every week. That means midday on Friday, not 9am the following Monday morning. A number of business processes - including scheduling, revenue forecasting and cashflow - need accurate data to drive them on a Monday. Any timesheet submitted after 12pm on a Friday impacts our ability to generate good quality data and causes significant extra work for the Ops and Finance teams. Please do them on time!

## Timesheet approval process

Once a team member has submitted their timesheet on Friday by 12pm, Delivery Managers and Service Area owners need to [approve their team's timesheets](https://trello.com/c/k12r2uja/40-approving-timesheets) by 1pm.

### Why we need to approve timesheets

Timesheet data directly drives our client invoicing, so it’s important it’s accurate and complete at the end of every week. It will also save you time when checking invoice accuracy at the end of the month. When approving timesheets for the week we need to:
* Check your team has completed their timesheet in full; and has accurately recorded the time they spent on the project (inc. absences like illness and holidays)
* Account for any differences between the team’s forecast time and their actual time spent and report this to the Operations team

The review and approval process should take 5-10 minutes; and picking up any errors or unexplained differences saves the business a lot of time!

We also ask that if you are going on holiday, that you allocate it to another Delivery Manager or senior member of the team. Scheduling can change this in Kimble, and change it back to you when you return.
