# How to timesheet

## General

Made Tech hours are 35 per week, 7 hours per day full time. Part-time hours are prorated and reflected in Harvest according to your agreed hours. 

Only billable team members need to complete a timesheet and you will be notified at your onboarding session if you need to complete one. The timesheet must be completed to account for all of your time in the working week. 

Time can be completed in advance but in your unplanned absence your delivery manager can complete your timesheet. 

## When to submit your time

Time sheets need to be submitted weekly every Friday by midday. It needs to be completed weekly because it is likely to be a truer reflection of time and we are able to accurately invoice the client using this information.
 
When the end of the month falls on a week day other than Friday, you will be asked to submit a timesheet up until the end of the month. This will be in addition to the Friday timesheet meaning you need to complete 2 in a week. 

E.g. June 30 falls on a Tuesday, your timesheet needs to be submitted up until Tuesday i.e. 7 hours for Monday and 7 hours for Tuesday. The rest of the week (Wednesday to Friday) will be included in the Friday timesheet. 

Reminders are given through automated messages in Slack. 

## What categories should I allocate my time to?

All of your 35 hours should be allocated to the category/ies where you spend your time. This will either be a client project or an internal project or a combination of both.

## Client projects

Client projects are separated into 3 categories; Billed, Investment and Chalet, you will be allocated to one as appropriate. 

## Made Tech internal projects


You may be on an internal project full time or in conjunction with a client project. These need to be added in the same way as a client project and your time needs to be input against these projects, not exceeding 35 hours in total. 

Some categories should be used where there is significant time spent, i.e. 2 hours or more

* Absence - sick leave and a specified break from Learn Tech
* Academy - assisting with the academy programme
* Certifications (chalet) - currently studying for a certification
* Chalet - you are not currently on a project and are available
* Conferences - external events and conferences
* Culture and happiness - assisting with the service area
* Holidays - vacation time
* Learn tech - every Friday 3.5 hours (unless a specified break in which case this is under absence).

* Onboarding - you are attending onboarding week
* Recruitment - assisting in interviewing or recruitment activities
