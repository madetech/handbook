# Chalet time policy

This document describes where and how people should spend time when not on client work -  known as chalet time. The purpose is to make sure people use this time to build their skills, grow Made Tech’s business and contribute to communities of practice.

## What is chalet time?

Chalet time is when people are not on client work.
For example, there is a two week gap for someone finishing the software engineering academy and going onto a client project. Another example, a Lead Designer having three days between their current client project and the next.

Occasional chalet time is part of a business like ours, as client work isn’t always going to perfectly match our skills and who is available to work in different teams.
However, used the right way, chalet time can be valuable to grow skills, our business and contribute to communities of practice.

## Responsibility for using chalet time usefully

People with chalet time and their line managers will be responsible to ensure this time is used usefully.

Line management should therefore focussed partly on:

- Agree weekly goals to use chalet time according the highest priorities
- Check together progress against goals for chalet time in Small Improvements
- Agree a plan to get someone onto billed client work
- Identify blockers someone has doing activities with their chalet time
- Identify where the organisation someone needs their line manager to introduce them to and in some situations advocare for them to join

Each Head of Capability Practice is ultimately accountable for everyone in their practice using chalet time the right way.  This will be measured by the average people’s time is billed to a client, also known as utilisation. Heads of Capability Practices will report each week how people are using chalet time, as part of weekly utilisation meetings with Operations.

## Priorities for chalet time

The priorities for using chalet time will always stay the same, but what activities you do will depend on your roles and availability.
If there are no activities that need to be done that match your role and availability, chalet time should be used for the next highest priority. For example, if there are no activities that someone could do to find new opportunities on client teams or new business and revenue, people would do hiring activities.

Priorities for chalet time:

#### 1. New opportunities on client teams

## Length of chalet time activities

Chalet time activities must be able to deliver some value in small blocks of time: half day, single day or 3–5 days, meaning chalet time can add value if someone joins a client team at short notice.

Some activities may need more than a week but still be able to deliver business or personal value in increments of a half day, single day or 3–5 days.
