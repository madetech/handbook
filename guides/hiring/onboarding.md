# Onboarding 

The Head of People conducts an onboarding session with all new starters. This includes:
 - Issuing the new starter with their device (unless they have opted for BYOD)
 - Registering that device on Charlie HR
 - Setting up BPSS checks for the new starter (usually in advance of their first day)
 - Ensuring the new starter is set up on, and understands, our internal SaaS solutions, such as (but not limited to): Harvest, Slack, G Suite, etc.
 - Using The Made Tech Handbook to familiarise the new starter with Made Tech’s aims, objectives and procedures in general. 
 - Setting up sessions with relevant departments (such as Operations, or Sales) and introducing the new starter to their line manager.

## Probation Period
There is a probation period of three or six months, depending on circumstances. 
 - During this time, the new joiner will have a one-to-one with their line manager every two weeks. 
 - At the end of the probation period the joiner will be informed they have: passed their probation, it will be extended, or they have not passed, in which case they will be released.
 - Small Improvements is used to track an individual’s progress through their probation period. 

## Security Checks 
 - All team members are BPSS screened by our external partner agency, CB Screening.
 - Some team members work on sensitive Public Sector systems and have been Security Cleared.
 - We work with our clients to ensure our team have the necessary security clearance to perform their role

## Contracts
Employee contracts and other documentation are held in CharlieHR.
