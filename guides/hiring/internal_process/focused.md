# Focused Interview

The [who interview](who.md) is comprehensive and will get you most of the way toward the right answer of who to hire. Conduct it in tandem with a colleague, and the two of you will have a rich dataset to work from. 

Focused interviews allow you to gather additional, specific information about your candidate. In essence, you are turning the magnification up another notch so you can give would-be hires one last look with a finer degree of granularity.

The questions follow a very simple structure (just like the other interviews) and we should lead with the primary questions to get the conversation started. As with all of the interviews, [get curious after every answer by using the “What? How? Tell me more” framework](screening.md#getting-curious), and keep asking until you understand what the person did and how he or she did it.
