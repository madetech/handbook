# Candidate Scorecard

The first failure point of hiring is not being crystal clear about what you really want the person you hire to accomplish. To address this, we use a candidate scorecard, which is a document that describes exactly what we want a person to accomplish in a role. 

The scorecard is composed of three parts: the job’s [mission](#mission), [outcomes](#outcome), and [competencies](#competencies). Together, these three pieces describe A* performance in the role, what a person must accomplish, and how. They provide a clear linkage between the people we hire and our business strategy. 

###How to create a scorecard

**Mission - ** Develop a short statement of one to five sentences that describes why a role exists. For example, “The mission for the head of support is to work with our support customers to ensure they are receiving the highest level of service possible.”

**Outcomes - ** Develop three to eight specific, objective outcomes that a person must accomplish to achieve an A performance.

**Competencies - ** Identify as many role-based competencies as you think appropriate to describe the behaviors someone must demonstrate to achieve the outcomes. Next, identify five to eight competencies that describe your culture and place those on every scorecard. For example, “Competencies include efficiency, organisation, honesty and a customer service mentality.”

Pressure-test your scorecard by comparing it with the business objectives and scorecards of the people who will interface with the role. Ensure that there is consistency and alignment. Then share the scorecard with relevant parties, including peers and recruiters.
