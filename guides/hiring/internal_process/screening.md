# Telephone Screening Guide

The telephone screening process is designed to save time by eliminating candidates that shouldn't make it in for a face to face interview. 

We follow a common set of questions every time we screen somebody. The commonality fosters consistency across our team and improves our ability to discern differences between candidates.

### Preparation

Before the call you should review the [scorecard](scorecard.md) to refresh your memory. Begin the call by setting expectations, saying something like this: 

> Hey Joe, Thanks for taking the time to speak today. I'm really looking forward to hearing what you've been up to. In terms of structure for this call, I would like to spend the first twenty minutes getting to know you. After that, I am happy to answer any questions you have so you can get to know us. That sound ok?”

### Four Primary Questions

Following the introduction, move straight into four primary questions. You've got twenty minutes to try and build a picture of the candidate and understand their true strengths and weaknesses. 

#####1. What are your career goals? 

This first question is powerful because it allows you to hear about a candidate’s goals and passions before you taint the discussion with your own comments. You give the candidate the first word, rather than telling the person about the company so he or she can parrot back what you just said. 

#####2. What are you really good at professionally? 

This second question will generate plenty of dialogue. You won’t have any trouble getting people to list their strengths. 

* Push candidates to tell you eight to twelve positives so you can build a complete picture of their professional aptitude. 
* Ask them to give you specific examples that will put their strengths into context. 
* Press the candidate for further details if the examples are poor. Use the [getting curious](#getting-curious) method to do this. e.g. Follow-up questions that begins with “What,” “How,” or “Tell me more.” Keep using this until you are clear about what the person is really saying.

#####3. What are you not good at or not interested in doing professionally?

The third question captures the other side of the balance sheet. You may have to probe, as candidates are often reluctant to reveal too much. 

* Don't outright ask for weaknesses as this will likely yield self-serving answers like “I am impatient for results” or “I work too hard.” Instead, let the candidates answer as they will. 
* If not satisfied, push them harder for a real weakness or a real area for development. 
* If you still can't get anything valuable, use the FORC (Fear of reference check) on the candidate. The thought that you will be talking to references and verifying the candidate’s answers compels the candidate to be much more truthful and complete than usual. 
* Once a candidate has opened up, aim to get three to five weaknesses from them.

#####4. Who were your last 5 bosses and how would they each rate your performance on a 1-10 scale *when* we talk to them?

* Note the use of **when** in the question. This slight nuance is key to unlocking the truth. 
* Ask the candidate to list each boss and offer a rating for each. Follow up by pressing for details using the [getting curious](#getting-curious) method. 
* Candidates will typically reinforce and expand upon the list of strengths and weaknesses they gave you in response to questions two and three. 
* We are looking for lots of 8’s, 9’s, and 10’s in the ratings. Consider 7’s neutral; 6’s and below are actually bad. 
* If you hear too many 6’s and below, screen them out, but be sure to really listen to what is being said. 

###Getting Curious
Unless you follow up on your questions, you won’t get all the answers you need We use a simple process called “getting curious.” and here’s how it works:

After a candidate answers one of the primary questions above, get curious about the answer by asking a follow-up question that begins with “What,” “How,” or “Tell me more.” Keep using this until you are clear about what the person is really saying. 

Sample questions include: What do you mean? What did that look like? What happened? What is a good example of that? What was your role? What did you do? What did your boss say? What were the results? What else? How did you do that? How did that go? How did you feel? How much money did you save? How did you deal with that? 

It can seem like you are probing a lot, but this is a key step in an important who decision that can affect your entire company. You should be pushing candidates to be as clear and precise as possible by asking “what” and “how” questions. When you have no idea what else to ask, just say, “Tell me more.” They will keep talking. We promise.
