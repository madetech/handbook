# Our hiring process

We believe that our hiring process should be [fair and repeatable](rationale.md).

## Pipeline

 - Define a need and expectation for hiring
 - Candidate
 - Screen
 - Interview & Pair
 - Decide
 - Hire

Our pipeline is tracked on a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/0kmnv5Wo/recruitment).

### Define a need and expectation for hiring

As described in our [Roles at Made Tech](/roles/README.md) document, candidates must be judged against a specific role with the needs and expectations of that role explicitly defined. This allows us to judge candidates like for like and also keeps us focused on the reason for a hire. Internally, the person leading the hiring should create a [candidate scorecard](internal_process/scorecard.md) to detail the specific [mission](internal_process/scorecard.md#mission), [outcomes](internal_process/scorecard.md#outcomes) and [competencies](internal_process/scorecard.md#competencies) that we are looking for, which should enable us to compare candidates like-for-like.  

### Candidate

Once we have a need and expectation for a role and a [candidate scorecard](internal_process/scorecard.md), we will then reach out our marketing efforts to advertise the role on our site and elsewhere. We will also hand the role to trusted recruiters and spread the word amongst our existing staff.

When a candidate gets in touch we place them in our Trello board. We then use this Trello board to track the candidate across our pipeline. The Trello card should contain all details we have on the candidate including but not limited to:

 - Candidate scorecard (as Google Doc)
 - Email address
 - GitHub profile
 - Covering letter
 - CV
 - LinkedIn profile

### Screening

We then need to screen the candidate in order to determine what role they are a good fit for. At this stage its worth keeping an open mind as to what role the candidate might fill, however the need and expectation for that role must have already been set.

We use the following steps in order to determine a role for the candidate:

 - Review application (CV, GitHub, LinkedIn, covering letter)
 - Telephone screening
 - Remote test

#### Review application

We first review a candidates application to ensure the later steps are worth our while. This decision should be based on merits, nothing but a lack of merits should disqualify someone from this stage. The candidate can proceed past this step if we can answer yes to the following question:

> Does their application contain experience to indicate that they may be able to meet our expectations of one or more roles?

#### Telephone screening

Next we should organise a telephone interview with the candidate. This will be the first opportunity to speak with the candidate and should follow our [telephone screening](internal_process/screening.md) process.

#### Remote test

Provided all went well during the [telephone screening](internal_process/screening.md) we may ask the candidate to take a remote test. 

The remote test will have a marking guide so that applications can be judged objectively against a set of criteria. We will also provide the marking guide to candidates so that they can see exactly what we are looking for.

A few things to note about the remote test:

 - If a candidate has a significant portfolio of code samples that pass our marking guide then they can skip the remote test altogether
 - If 80% or more is scored on the test the candidate automatically qualifies for the next step
 - A remote test will take a lot longer for a less experienced candidate but should still be passable
 - A submission cannot be judged on any other criteria than that of the marking guide

*We currently only have a [remote test](remote_test/README.md) for our [Engineer role](/roles/engineer.md#engineer-role).*

### Interview

The candidate is invited into our offices for an hour and a half. We split this time as follows:

 - Introduction to Made (10 minutes)
 - [Discussion of previous experience](internal_process/who.md) (30 minutes)
 - Pairing session (30 minutes)
 - Problem solving (20 minutes)
 - Questions (10 minutes)

#### Introduction to Made

We usually ask the candidate if they have any more questions about what we do, and what the role looks like. It also helps break the ice of the interview conditions.

#### Discussion of previous experience

We then ask the candidate to explain how they got to where they are now. We should follow our [experience assessment](internal_process/who.md) process.

#### Pairing session

After this introduction we usually pair with a candidate on a problem for 30 minutes. This step is used to see how well a candidate communicates and works with us. Of course it is a pressured environment, however we try and make the candidate at ease by sharing some of the work and discussing the problem with them.

Our current Engineer pairing task can be found in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/a/madebymade.co.uk/document/d/1nqKNcy9wGcQjAOD-nYP_KtXLFyDQD6KEEhGw6_Andik/edit?usp=sharing). (Sorry if you're a candidate looking at this, we do not hand out these questions in advance.)

#### Problem solving

We follow up with some more technical, deeper thinking questions documented in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gzOeu_a9uPdOA0roY1oMo_S4pLQCCdrysgyFANcu0FA/edit#gid=1588607612). (Sorry if you're a candidate looking at this, we do not hand out these questions in advance.)

#### Questions

Finally we answer any questions the candidate may have.

###Â Decide

We will hire a candidate if all interviewers answer yes to all of the following questions:

 - Do we have a strong indication based on their past experience that they will be able to fulfil our expectations for their role and traits?
 - Do we have a strong indication based on their pairing session that they will be able to fulfil our expectations for their role and traits?
 - Do we have a strong indication based on their problem solving that they will be able to fulfil our expecations for their role and traits?

### Hire

Once we've determined that a candidate is going to be a good hire for us and the candidate thinks we're a good fit for their next role, we will offer them the position. We will prepare a contract and send it to them as soon as possible.

After this the [on-boarding process](/company/first_day.md) begins.
