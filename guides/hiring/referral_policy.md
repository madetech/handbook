# Employee Referral Policy

The main purpose of this employee referral policy is for everyone at Made Tech to use when they need information about how Made Tech’s referral programme works.


## Policy Statements

If you know someone who you think would be a good addition for a position at Made Tech, please do refer them via our [Pinpoint platform](https://made-tech.pinpointhq.com/employee-dashboard/referral_jobs). If we end up hiring your referred candidate, you may receive a referral payment if eligible. Use the policy guidelines below to determine your eligibility.

Made Tech will give payments to employees who refer qualified candidates for our job openings.

This is how our employee referral programme works:


| Monetary Amount     | Roles | Payment amt on start date | Payment amt after probation |
| ------------------: | :--------------: | -------------------------:| --------------------------: |
| £500                | Apprentices  |                      £250 |                        £250 | |
| £1500               | All other roles  |                      £500 |                       £1000 |


__Charity__ – should you wish to not take us up on the personal financial incentive then you can opt to make a charitable donation which we will make on your behalf to our associated charity for the given year of the campaign.

## Who is eligible to take part?

All our employees are eligible to take part in this program – as such the program does not include contractors or third-party vendors.

The only other people exempt from participation are:
* Anyone working in our talent roles and hiring managers for positions for which they’re hiring.


## Who can be referred?

The only groups of people who **cannot** be referred are candidates:
* That have applied and been unsuccessful in the past 6 months
* Who have terminated from employment with us for any reason within the last 18 months (for example, including resignations). 
* Current contractors

## Additional rules for rewards

* Rewards will be processed within 30 days of each stage and processed in the next available pay run.
* We never say no to receiving a profile of a referral and will ensure that someone from our Talent team will review the profile and aim to take action within 5 working days. However, during busy periods, this may take longer. You can refer as many times as you wish. Please be sure to evaluate our roles and requirements and make a judgement on suitability to ensure everyone’s time and expectations are well managed.
* The candidate being referred must be someone the employee personally knows through a professional or a personal relationship and we will check the validity of the referral before offer stage.
* If the same candidate is referred by multiple employees, the first employee who makes the referral gets a reward, so act fast if you know someone that could be suited to our open positions.
* There is a 12 month time limit on a referred candidate, meaning if you refer someone to us and they are not right for the current positions now, you could still receive a payment if they are hired in the next 12 months. You will however not receive a payment if you leave Made Tech.
* Any financial reward is open to the usual PAYE deductions (tax), please contact People Ops via our Ask Made Tech portal should you have any questions regarding the deductions – which will be automatically made in your pay cycle.


Thank you to all of our Made Tech teammates for taking the time to consider their networks, social and professional as potential resources for referred candidates.


We may change our referral programme over time. We also reserve the right to remove certain rewards if they prove ineffective or inefficient. We’ll communicate any change in a clear and timely manner. Employees who referred candidates before a reward incentive was removed or changed will still receive the appropriate reward.


We’d like to remind our employees that we are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate against protected characteristics. We guarantee that all candidates will be given the same consideration and will pass through our established procedure.
