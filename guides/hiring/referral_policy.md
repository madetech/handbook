# Employee Referral Policy

The main purpose of this employee referral program policy is for our employees and all the
People and Talent Team to use when they need detail and information about how Made Tech’s referral programs work.

If you know someone who you think would be a good fit for a position at our company, feel free to refer them via [Workable](https://made-tech.workable.com/referrals).
If we end up hiring your referred candidate, you may receive a referral payment.
Use the policy guidelines below to determine your eligibility.

## Policy Statements

Our company will give incentives and bonuses to employees who refer qualified candidates for Made Tech’s job openings.

This is how our employee referral reward program works:

This Employee Referral Program Policy applies to all our employees who refer a candidate to our company.

__Charity__ – should you wish to not take us up on any of the exciting incentives then you can opt to make a charitable donation which we will make on your behalf to our associated charity for the given year of the campaign.

## Who is eligible to take part?

All our permanent employees are eligible to take part in this program – as such the program does not include contractors or third-party vendors.

The only people exempt from participation are:

> Recruiters and hiring managers for positions for which they’re hiring.

## Who can be referred?

Not all candidates can be referred. The only groups of people who cannot be referred include candidates:

* That have applied in the past 6 months
* Who were previously terminated from employment with us for any reason

## Additional rules for rewards

* Employees will receive awards within 30 days of each stage
* We never say no to a receiving a profile of a referral and will ensure that someone from our
TA team contacts that individual within 72hrs of receipt of the profile – you can refer as many time as you wish.
Please be sure to evaluate our roles and requirements and make a judgement on suitability to ensure everyone’s time and expectations are well managed.
* If the same candidate is referred by multiple employees, the first employee gets a reward, so act fast if you know someone that could be suited to our open positions.
* There is a 12 month time limit on a referred candidate, meaning if you refer someone to us and they are not right for the current positions now, you could still receive a payment if they are hired in the next 12 months.
You will however not receive a payment if you leave Made Tech.
* The amount of the reward will align to the level set at the time the introduction was made
* Any financial reward is of course open to taxation and as such please contact finance should you have any questions regarding the deductions – which will be automatically made in your pay cycle

Thank you to all of our Made Tech employees for taking the time to consider their networks, social and professional as potential resources for referred candidates.

We may change our referral bonus program over time to add more interesting incentives.
We also reserve the right to abolish certain rewards if they prove ineffective or inefficient.
We’ll communicate any change in a clearly and timely manner.
Employees who referred candidates before a reward was abolished will still receive the appropriate reward.

We’d like to remind our employees that we are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate against protected characteristics.
Our referred candidates may take precedence in the hiring process.
We guarantee that all candidates will be given the same consideration and will pass through our established procedures.
