# Rationale

We believe that our hiring process should be fair and repeatable. What do we mean by this?

## Fair

Made is an equal opportunity employer that is committed to inclusion and diversity. There is a simple reason to this, we know that having people of all different walks of life provide us with new view points and better our ability to achieve our mission.

## Repeatable

We want to be able to continually hire new staff! We wish to grow and we recognise in order to do this we require a pipeline that provides consistent results. Ideally we would have a pipeline where we could increase our spend and therefore increase our levels of hiring.

## Achieving fair and Repeatable

In order to achieve fair and repeatable hiring we need to define a process. As with the rest of our business we experiment and iterate with our hiring process. By having a clearly defined pipeline we can optimise and change it through conversation. We can also repeat successes by repeating our process.
