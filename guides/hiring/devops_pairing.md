DevOps pairing works similarly to [regular pairing](./pairing.md)
Please [read the regular pairing document](./pairing.md) before this one

## Goals

- Our DevOps pairing process is designed to simulate solving a real problem in a delivery
Therefore work should be done on an actual cloud account so that the pair can work past unexpected problems

- We insist on using infrastructure as code so that interviews can demonstrate these skills as this is often always used in a delivery

## Preparing to pair
The DevOps pairing process needs a little more preparation than normal
- For pairing in AWS [you will need a cloud account to use](../cloud/aws_sandbox.md)
- Use [this terraform project](https://github.com/madetech/devops-pairing-terraform) to create temporary credentials for the pair

## Writing code together
Currently, we are still building the exercises to use for this kind of interview. For a link to the currently used exercise check the channel topic/description in slack `#cop-cloud`

## Ending the pairing session
When there are five minutes left in the session:
- Start to Destroy the resources created in the session
- While this is happening, it's good to ask how they thought the interview went, what they would change etc
