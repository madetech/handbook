## Learning & Development at Made Tech

Learning & Mentoring is a core value at Made Tech and we strive to continuosly learn and improve ourselves. We want to share our own knowledge with others and default to a mentoring mindset when doing so internally and externally.

## What resources are available to develop myself

All team members have 12 days per year of personal learning time that can be used flexibly - i.e 1 day a month, a 1 week block or 3 days per quarter - whatever works best for you. You may request more days if needed, and if this is supporting your career progression. 

You will get a personal learning budget of Â£300 via our online learning platform, Learnerbly where you can access a variety of content, including buying books. 

In addition to that, there will a variety of internally created content, plus partnerships with external providers for learning that we can't delivery inhouse - such as certifications and specialised courses.

We also have a company wide learning budget for further training and courses. Our L&D Experience Manager is the best person to speak to if you want to learn more.

* The 12 days should be focussed on attaining, and/or improving skills relevant to your role at Made Tech.

## Showcases

Showcases are free-form - every Friday between 16:30 and 17:00 there is an opportunity to present to the team.

Use this as an opportunity to share with the wider group something of interest.

This could be, for example, how you applied TDD discipline on your delivery team, it could be how you approached infrastructure as code at your previous company or another learning topic such as 'What is active listening' 

* All permanent employees are expected to attend and be on time.


### Core Skills

Our Engineering team has built some Core Skills, which are courses around topics valuable to Made Tech.

Currently, each Core Skill is comprised of 3 levels, with acompanying stickers (which you will see on people's laptops).

You earn these stickers by doing coursework, or by passing an assessment, set by members of the Engineering team with expertise in that skill.
