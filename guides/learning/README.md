## Learning & Development at Made Tech

Learning and mentoring is a core value at Made Tech. We strive to continuously learn and improve ourselves. We want to share our own knowledge with others and adopt a mentoring mindset, both with team members and clients.

## What resources are available to develop myself

You will get a personal learning budget of £300 which is ready for you to use in Learnerbly, our online learning platform. You can access a variety of content, including books, online and offline courses, and even individual coaching sessions. It’s important that you use your budget on resources that directly link to your development here at Made Tech, whether that’s for your current role or a promotion you’re working towards.
There is also a variety of learning content developed and shared by people at Made Tech, plus partnerships with external providers for anything that we can't deliver in-house, like certifications and specialised courses.

### When joining Made Tech
Both the number of learning days and your learning budget allowances will be pro-rated based on your joining date:
- Q1 starters- 12 learning days and £300 personal learning spend 
- Q2 starters - 9 learning days and £225 personal learning spend
- Q3 starters - 6 learning days and £150 personal learning spend
- Q4 starters - 3 learning days and £75 personal learning spend

### When leaving Made Tech

- Learning spend and learning days will be withdrawn as a benefit from the day it has been agreed that they will be leaving the business (e.g. when someones notice  has been accepted)
- If someone has used more learning days than their prorated amount, the cost of the days will be clawed back by deduction from your final pay packet
- We will not claw back any of your allocated personal learning spend

### When do the learning allowances expire?

If you joined Made Tech before the 1st September 2021 
- Your learning allowance expires on the 31st December 2021

We are in the process of aligning the learning allowance calendar to the Made Tech Financial year, this means you will be given 6 learning days and a personal learning budget of £150 to spend between the 1st January to the 31st May 2022. Then the allowances will be reset and the full year allowance will be given to spend between the 1st June 2022 to the 21st May 2023.

However, if you joined on or after the 1st September 2021
- Your learning allowance expires on the 31st May 2022
- You will be give a new, full year allowance on the 1st June 2022

## Showcases

Showcases are free-form - every Friday between 16:30 and 17:00 there is an opportunity to present to the team.

Use this as an opportunity to share with the wider group something of interest.

This could be, for example, how you applied TDD discipline on your delivery team, it could be how you approached infrastructure as code at your previous company or another learning topic such as 'What is active listening' 

* All permanent employees are expected to attend and be on time.


### Core Skills

Our Engineering team has built some Core Skills, which are courses around topics valuable to Made Tech.

Currently, each Core Skill is comprised of 3 levels, with acompanying stickers (which you will see on people's laptops).

You earn these stickers by doing coursework, or by passing an assessment, set by members of the Engineering team with expertise in that skill.
