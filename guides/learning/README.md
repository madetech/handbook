### When joining Made Tech
Based on the feedback we have received that more junior roles in Made Tech would beenfit from having an increased budget available to support their development earlier in their careers, and that senior roles would beenfit from investment in a more custom learning programme, we introduced a tapered amount dependent on role level. 

### When leaving Made Tech
