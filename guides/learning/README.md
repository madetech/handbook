# Learning

## Learn Tech

Every Friday between 13:30 and 17:00 the team come together to focus on learning new or developing existing skills.

Learn Tech consists of a number of tracks, where the whole company learn everything we need to know to make Made Tech an even more brilliant team. Tracks will run periodically throughout the year, between which more free-form learn tech sessions or personal development will take place.

* All permanent employees are expected to attend and be on time.
* The time should be focussed on attaining, or be defining and/or improving skills relevant to your role at Made Tech.

## Showcases

Showcases are more free-form - between 16:30 and 17:00 there is an opportunity to present to the team.

Use this as an opportunity to share with the wider group something of interest.

This could be, for example, how you applied TDD discipline on your delivery team, or it could be how you approached infrastructure as code at your previous company.

## Engineer roles

### Onboarding

Before joining a delivery team, you will spend some time with a mentor focussing on skills relevant to delivery teams.

As a high level summary, we will cover the following -

1. Watch the [introduction to TDD screencast](https://learn.madetech.com/videos/tennis.html).
2. (Pair or mob with a mentor on) [code katas](https://learn.madetech.com/katas) using [Test Driven Development](https://learn.madetech.com/core-skills/tdd/) discipline.
3. (Pair or mob with a mentor on) subcutaneous acceptance testing, and ATDD discipline.
4. Explore with a mentor the central architectural concepts of Clean Architecture
5. Discuss the SOLID principles with a mentor, with reference to Clean Architecture and (A)TDD.
6. Be introduced to the [Tic Tac Toe sparring exercise](https://learn.madetech.com/sparring/tic-tac-toe/)

### Core Skills

Our Engineering team has built some Core Skills, which are courses around topics valuable to Made Tech.

Currently, each Core Skill is comprised of 3 levels, with acompanying stickers (which you will see on people's laptops).

You earn these stickers by doing coursework, or by passing an assessment, set by members of the Engineering team with expertise in that skill.
