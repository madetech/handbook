# Learning and development at Made Tech

Learning and mentoring is a core value at Made Tech. We strive to continuously learn and improve ourselves. We want to share our own knowledge with others and adopt a mentoring mindset, both with team members and clients.


## What resources are available?

You'll get a personal learning budget of £300 which is ready for you to use in Learnerbly, our online learning platform. You can access a variety of content, including books, online and offline courses, and even individual coaching sessions. It’s important that you use your budget on resources that directly link to your development here at Made Tech, whether that’s for your current role or a promotion you’re working towards.
There is also a variety of learning content developed and shared by people at Made Tech, plus partnerships with external providers for anything that we can't deliver in-house, like certifications and specialised courses.


### When joining Made Tech

Your learning budget allowances will be pro-rated based on your joining date:
- Q1 starters - £300 personal learning spend
- Q2 starters - £225 personal learning spend
- Q3 starters - £150 personal learning spend
- Q4 starters - £75 personal learning spend


### When leaving Made Tech

Learning allowance will end as a benefit from the day it’s confirmed that a team member will be leaving Made Tech (e.g. when their notice has been accepted). We Won't claw back any of your allocated personal learning spend. 

## Showcases

We have showcases every Friday between 4:30pm and 5pm. You'll get opportunities to present to the team, or learn something new from other teammates. All full-time team members should come along when work commitments allow.

### Core Skills

Our engineering community has built some core skills, which are courses on topics valuable to Made Tech.
Each core skill has 3 levels, with accompanying stickers (which you will see on people's laptops).
You earn these stickers by doing coursework, or by passing an assessment, set by members of the engineering team with expertise in that skill.
