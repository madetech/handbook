# Learning and development at Made Tech

Learning and mentoring is a core value at Made Tech. We strive to continuously learn and improve ourselves. We want to share our own knowledge with others and adopt a mentoring mindset, both with team members and clients.


## What resources are available?

You'll receive a learning budget which is ready for you to use in Learnerbly, our online learning platform. You can access a variety of content, including books, online and offline courses, and even individual coaching sessions. It’s important that you use your budget on resources that directly link to your development here at Made Tech, whether that’s for your current role or a promotion you’re working towards.
There is also a variety of learning content developed and shared by people at Made Tech, plus partnerships with external providers for anything that we can't deliver in-house, like certifications and specialised courses.


### When joining Made Tech
Our plan for FY24 is to introduce a tapered appraoch to learning budgets. Whilst we are still working on finalising localised learning priorities, we will be assigning a proportioned amount to all team members for Q1. 


### When leaving Made Tech

Learning allowance will end as a benefit from the day it’s confirmed that a team member will be leaving Made Tech (e.g. when their notice has been accepted). We Won't claw back any of your allocated personal learning spend. 

## Showcases

We have showcases every Friday between 4:30pm and 5pm. You'll get opportunities to present to the team, or learn something new from other teammates. All full-time team members should come along when work commitments allow.

We are currently refreshing our whole approach to learning and mentoring at Made Tech, in doing this, we intend to adopt an agile approach - introducing and experimenting in stages to validate their impact and scalability. This handbook will be updated regularly to include our new learning initiatives.
