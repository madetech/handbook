# How do I book learning time? 

## How long are you taking?

We trust you'll use your best judgement when taking time for personal learning, but in case you want some guidance on the kind of notice we expect when thinking about the time you take:
- Half a day to 1 day - We recommend giving at least 1 weeks notice
- Less than 1 week – We recommend giving at least 2 weeks notice for a 2 days off and closer to 4 weeks notice for more
- Between 1 and 2 weeks – We recommend giving at least 4 weeks notice for taking this amount of time, ideally more.

If you wish to book personal learning time outside of these guidelines, please raise this request with your team lead (i.e. delivery or tech lead on project work)  or the People Team who will help you plan for a longer time off.  You must do this before making any booking or confirming any course attendance.

## How will it affect your team?

Having several team members away at the same time can make life really difficult for everyone else. Try to forward-plan your learning time, so it doesn't have a detrimental effect on your team members, or on the company.
Please also note that some deliveries may have different requirements on notice periods, depending on client needs. 

We recommend you check with your Delivery Lead whenever you join a new team.
Our general guideline on this is that only 1 person from a small team (less than 4) may be away at any one time. For larger teams (5+) please refer to your Delivery or Team Lead to confirm what works best for your team. 
If you wish to book personal learning time outside of these guidelines, please raise this request with the People Team.

## Who approves personal learning time?

We want to ensure teams own their learning time and that includes thinking about the commercial impact of taking them. To that effect, we need to make sure you've done the following before booking time off:

- Ask your team members if it's okay with them, including your delivery manager/lead
- Ask your customers if it's okay with them (for non-billable roles, ensure internal projects won’t be adversely affected)
- Ensure your responsibilities are covered whilst you're away
- Ensure that the personal learning time is placed into CharlieHR

Ask your line manager, the Ops Team, and the People Team, if you wish to book personal learning time outside of the guidelines

## How do I record this time?

Just like booking a holiday

Log into CharlieHR

Navigate to book time off, (once it’s been okayed  by everyone) and then choose Learning Time from the drop down menu.

Remember pre-approval by your Team Leader is required before you book, it’s then auto-approved by CharlieHR.


### Only for Delivery, Tech, Product and other billable roles:
 
There is a new Learning and Development category to timesheet under in Harvest; [NOL-INT-106] Learning and Development. 
Please record your time under this category in half day or full day blocks of time. Your delivery manager/tech lead on your project will need to approve this time. 
The handbook has general timesheet instructions


## Next
For now you can only book a minimum of half day blocks, giving you a whole morning or afternoon. 
We're reviewing how to provide even more flexibility so you could book shorter periods of time for learning, i.e. 1 hour. 
We'll update this page as soon as that is possible.
