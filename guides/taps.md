# Taps

On a Friday, the drinks Taps need a small amount of work to mitigate the need for a full cleaning cycle in the following week.

Closing out on Friday steps:

1. Turn the black knob on the back fully counter-clockwise until it clicks (this is off)
2. Turn the tap flow control to the fully off position
3. Open the taps fully to clear through the last amount of beer (it is normal for the flow to not be reduced to 0%)
4. Use a sponge to remove any debris from the tap outlets
5. Cover the taps with a small amount of clingfilm
6. Leave the drip tray in the sink for the cleaner
