# Software Engineer 1

Bristol, Manchester & London, UK.

Our Engineers build software that makes our customers happy, they prefer problem solving over task completing, love learning from colleagues, and constantly strive to be nice humans.

## What does the job entail?

We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. We work across central and local government, as well as in health, and our past lies in the technology startup world. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery; ensuring our customer’s goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.

Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release. Also, we will usually be responsible for setting up a customer’s infrastructure too! Such as on AWS, GCP or Azure using a tool like Terraform, though sometimes we opt for a Platform as a Service like Heroku.

## What experience are we looking for?

All of our Software Engineers are trained first as an [Academy Software Engineer](academy_software_engineer.md) within our 12 week Academy programme. We don't currently hire people into this role without them first going through our Academy.
