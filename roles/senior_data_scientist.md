# Senior Data Scientist

Our Data Scientists enable public sector organisations to unlock the value and the potential of their data, extracting insights and helping organisations to make informed decisions. They collaborate closely with our clients in all aspects of the project - from understanding the data, to interpreting model's output and model deployment. They seek to provide reliable answers and deliver maximum value to stakeholders.

## Your role at Made Tech

At Made Tech we want to positively impact the future of the government by using technology to improve society, for everyone. We want to empower the public sector to deliver and continuously improve digital services that are user-centric, data-supported and freed from legacy technology. A key component of this is developing modern data systems that enable informed decision-making for our clients.

As a Data Scientist, you may play one or more roles according to our clients' needs. You could be working closely with clients to help shape their data strategy alongside our data engineers. At other times the role can be very hands-on, and you'll serve in a senior contributor role to projects, focusing on both delivering data science solutions and upskilling members of the client team. Sometimes, you might have to play the role of an advisor, suggesting to clients how data science is done and helping them set up their data science environment. At other times you will be working with the other members of data engineering teams and performing exploratory data analysis.

As a senior member of the data capability within Made Tech, you will also participate in our hiring process and continued development of the team, as well as representing us both internally to the organisation and publicly. You will also line-manage members of the team up to the mid-level.

You’ll need to have a drive to deliver outcomes for users. You’ll need to be comfortable sharing your knowledge and skills with others. We'd love to hear some examples of times you’ve mentored, coached, and contributed to the growth of team members. Maybe you’ve written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two that you’d like to share.
