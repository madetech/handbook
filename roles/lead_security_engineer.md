Please apply for this role at [www.madetech.com/careers](https://www.madetech.com/careers).

Our Lead Security Engineers enable public sector organisations to mitigate cyber and information security risks across an increasingly complex and threatened mix of technology-enabled services.

## What does the job entail?

At Made Tech we want to positively impact the future of the country by using technology to improve society, for everyone. We want to empower the public sector to deliver and continuously improve digital services that are user-centric, data-driven and freed from legacy technology. Underpinning this is a need for us to do this securely, handling public data safely, and defending against increasing cyber and information security risks.

As a Lead Security Engineer you will work closely with clients to help inform their security strategy and to ensure our teams are delivering secure digital services and cloud-based platforms, aligned to our customers risk tolerance. You will be expected to upskill clients and Made Tech delivery teams, including pair programming with other engineers.
