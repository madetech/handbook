# Lead Security Engineer

Our Lead Security Engineers enable public sector organisations to mitigate cyber and information security risks across an increasingly complex and threatened mix of technology-enabled services. They lead teams to make sure digital and data services are securely designed and built from the outset, and work with technology teams to make sure entire platforms are securely monitored with timely incident response.

## Your role at Made Tech

At Made Tech we want to positively impact the future of the country by using technology to improve society, for everyone. We want to empower the public sector to deliver and continuously improve digital services that are user-centric, data-driven and freed from legacy technology. Underpinning this is a need for us to do this securely, handling public data safely, and defending against increasing cyber and information security risks.

As a Lead Security Engineer you will work closely with clients to help inform their security strategy and to ensure our teams are delivering secure digital services and cloud-based platforms, aligned to our customers risk tolerance. You’ll need to have a drive to deliver outcomes for users. You’ll be expected to upskill clients and Made Tech delivery teams, including pair programming with other engineers. 

You will need to be comfortable sharing your knowledge and skills with others. We’d love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two that you’d like to share.
