# Principal Business Analyst
**Delivering world class client engagements.**

Our Principal Business Analysts are responsible for leading and delivering on strategically significant and complex client engagements across our portfolio of public sector clients.

* strong practice skills and subject matter expertise
* excellent leadership

We expect our Principal Business Analysts to bring all of this and to enthuse our strategy, analysis and design teams, and clients with the same passion.

They will bring thought leadership and  best-practice, honed through hands-on experience in both the private and public sector.  They will work with product managers, user researchers,  transformation leads, data analysts and client product owners to make ongoing recommended improvements to drive better user and business outcomes. 

They will often be responsible for leading transformation projects, helping teams to understand complex business scenarios, translating business drivers, goals and constraints into business outcomes, to define required capabilities that will enable our clients to expedite organisational change. 
 
Working in an Agile delivery setting alongside consultants, product managers, service designers, user researchers and transformation leads,  the Business Analysis Principal will oversee and be responsible for the hands-on delivery of business agility improvements. 

They will be comfortable blending the just in time delivery of key business analysis artefacts into the delivery teams  with continuous discovery and ideation of longer term epics and features.   

They will also coach and develop team members on their engagements providing them with detailed performance feedback, as well as monitoring overall delivery to achieve the highest levels of client satisfaction.

In addition, our Principal Business Analysts are responsible for engaging with our clients to understand their challenges and build lasting, trusted advisor relationships. They will also oversee multiple and concurrent client deliveries to help ensure quality and drive the sharing of best practice across our engagements and industries.
