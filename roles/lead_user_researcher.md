## Summary

Made Tech wants to positively impact the country's future by using technology to improve society. We believe being design-led can create positive outcomes in the public sector through critical services enabled by technology. We’ve built a community of designers and researchers to support the public sector's growing demand for a design-led approach to service delivery.

Lead User Researchers are expert practitioners who influence and mentor others. They work with teams to deeply understand people’s lives, services, organisations, and outcomes for the public sector.
