**Work as part of a Delivery Team to ensure the team is able to deliver at their full potential.**

Manchester, London, and Bristol UK.

Please apply for this role at [www.madetech.com/careers](https://www.madetech.com/careers). 


## What does the job entail?

Delivery Managers support delivery teams to meet their full potential. This will probably include facilitating scrum ceremonies and monitoring project budget, supporting team admin and managing project risk. You may work with a Lead or Principal Delivery Manager to manage stakeholder relationships, ensure successful delivery outcomes and lead external workshops.  

As a Delivery Manager, you will work on a small or mature agile team and learn on the job. At this level, you may work alongside a more senior delivery manager on a larger team, shadowing and providing support, or working to deliver an element themselves under guidance and mentorship. You will work under general direction and attempt to solve problems with your delivery team, but will seek out and accept guidance where necessary.

You’ll use cross-functional skills to support your delivery team deliver successful outcomes to the client. You use empathy and effective listening to help the team collaborate. You will use your previous project management experience to identify and manage project dependencies, risks and issues collectively with the team. You use your communication skills to help communicate complex information to technical and non-technical stakeholders, and facilitate discussion within a multidisciplinary team. You will be able to answer most questions that client stakeholders ask, but know who to speak to for more complex issues or queries.

With support, you will use your excellent attention to detail to ensure the project is delivered within budget, using tools such as Google Sheets to match up the time spent by the team with the amount of work left to complete.

You are passionate about learning and developing your skill set, so are an active member of the Delivery Community of Practice (COP), and spend time learning from other Capabilities (Cloud & Engineering, User Centred Design, Product & Business Analysis) about what good looks like in their areas of expertise.
