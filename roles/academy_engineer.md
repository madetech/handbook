# Academy Engineer

Our software delivery teams are the core of our business. They are usually comprised of a Lead Engineer, a Delivery Manager and one or more Engineers. As an Academy Engineer we expect someone:

## Expectations

### To be actively working towards becoming an Engineer

The Academy Engineer role is a temporary one. Our aim is for most Academy Engineers to move into an Engineer role after completing the 12 week academy programme or latest within 12 months. We will actively work with Academy Engineers to develop career development plans so it is clear on the steps needing to be taken in order to become an Engineer.

### To be in the office

We expect our Academy Engineers to be working from our office so that they can easily receive help from their colleagues. We have found that being physically present means it's much easier to ask colleagues for a quick bit of help. Not only that but it's important to build strong relationships with your colleagues and there is nothing like being in the office for doing that. All our other roles are remote friendly and we expect once you have been promoted to Engineer then you will have access to this benefit too.

### To be involved in improving the academy program for current and future cohorts

We expect Academy Engineers to have lots of opinions and feedback on our academy as they will have experienced it first hand. We expect this insight to be put to good use to improve our academy for current and future cohorts.

## Core Engineer Expectations

### To be actively practicing TDD

We expect our engineering team to write tests first by default. We expect every feature to be tested. Every Pull Request (or equivalent chunk of work put up for peer review) must contain a test. If for some reason there are extenuating circumstances for not writing tests then more than one engineer should peer review and verify this.

### To productively pair with their colleagues

We expect our engineering team to be friendly and lovely people to pair with. All pairing dynamics are different, sometimes you will be pairing with someone with less experience, sometimes you will have the same experience. Adjusting the speed of your work to accomodate for your pair is important and special care must be taken when mentoring/coaching those with less experience. No matter who you are pairing with you must take turns to compromise when your opinions differ.

### To request peer reviews for the code they write

We expect our engineering team to always have their code peer reviewed at the least by one other person before merging. It's the responsibility of the code author to ask their colleagues to review and to merge the code in a timely fashion.

### To provide meaningful and considerate peer reviews for others

We expect our engineering team to provide feedback that makes code safer, easier to maintain and advances the knowledge of the original author. We expect everyone to negotiate and compromise when making a call on whether feedback should be addressed or not.

### To regularly communicate with customers without reminder

We expect our engineering team to keep their customers up to date with progress. Customers should be invited to standups or at appropriate points in time. A customer should never have to chase us for an update.

### To keep their team updated on current work in progress

We expect our engineering team to keep their fellow team members up to date with their progress. A good litmus test for this is everyone on the team can describe what their team mates are up to.

### To ensure team ceremonies are held regularly

We expect our engineering team to ensure team ceremonies such as planning, retrospectives, and standups happen on a regular basis.

### To facilitate showcases and retrospectives

We expect our engineering team to be able to demonstrate the successes of their iterations with weekly showcases to customers. We also expect Engineers to be able to facilitate retrospectives with engaging formats and customer involvement. Good teams will rotate this responsibility on a weekly basis.

### To be responsible for the security of devices used for work

We expect our engineering team to understand how to secure the devices they use for work including work issued laptops, personal computers, mobile phones, and other electronic devices. We expect invididuals to ensure they adhere to our [security guidelines](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/master/guides/security/protect_the_company.md) upon setting up devices and to ensure that their machines are compliant at all times.

### To be involved in practice improvement discussions

We expect our engineering team to reflect on our practices and be a proactive voice in suggesting change. We expect you to be reflecting on your own development practices, reflecting on your team and the wider business.

### To keep timesheets up-to-date and submitted before invoicing deadlines

We use timesheets to invoice our customers, and it is important that we are able to send accurate invoices to our customers. We expect you to keep your timesheets up-to-date and to have submitted them before any invoicing deadlines.
