# Academy Engineer

Our software delivery teams are the core of our business. They are usually comprised of a Lead Engineer, a Delivery Manager and one or more Engineers.

As an Academy Engineer we expect someone:

## To be actively working towards becoming an Engineer

The Academy Engineer role is a temporary one. Our aim is for most Academy Engineers to move into an Engineer role after completing the 12 week academy programme or latest within 12 months.

We will actively work with Academy Engineers to develop career development plans so it is clear on the steps needing to be taken in order to become an Engineer.

## To be involved in practice improvement discussions

We expect everyone in our team to reflect on our practices and be a proactive voice in suggesting change. We expect you to be reflecting on your own development practices, reflecting on your team and the wider business.

## To be actively practicing TDD

We expect our engineers to write tests first by default. We expect every feature to be tested. Every Pull Request (or equivalent chunk of work put up for peer review) must contain a test. If for some reason there are extenuating circumstances for not writing tests then more than one engineer should peer review and verify this.

## To be able to productively pair with their colleagues

We expect our engineers to be friendly and lovely people to pair with. All pairing dynamics are different, sometimes you will be pairing with someone with less experience, sometimes you will have the same experience. Adjusting the speed of your work to accomodate for your pair is important and special care must be taken when mentoring/coaching those with less experience. No matter who you are pairing with you must take turns to compromise when your opinions differ.

## To be in the office

We expect our Academy Engineers to be working from our office so that they can easily receive help from their colleagues. We've found that being physically present means it's much easier to ask colleagues for a quick bit of help. Not only that but it's important to build strong relationships with your colleagues and there's nothing like being in the office for doing that. All our other roles are remote friendly and we expect once you have been promoted to Engineer then you will have access to this benefit too.

## To be requesting peer reviews for the code they write

We expect our engineers to always have their code peer reviewed at the least by one other person before merging. It's the responsibility of the code author to ask their colleagues to review and to merge the code in a timely fashion.

## To be involved in improving the academy program for current and future cohorts

We expect Academy Engineers to have lots of opinions and feedback on our academy as they will have experienced it first hand. We expect this insight to be put to good use to improve our academy for current and future cohorts.
