## Summary

Made Tech wants to positively impact the country's future by using technology to improve society. We believe being design-led can create positive outcomes in the public sector through critical services enabled by technology. We are building a community of designers and researchers to support the public sector growing demand for a design-led approach to service delivery.

They do this by influencing the direction, assuring the quality of design delivery within their team and by leading the end-to-end design of a chosen service.
