  expected 'to provide an outstanding customer service',
    'We expect our Live Services team to be delightful to interact with. Our conversations should be professional and friendly, we should small talk where possible, use a smiley face once in a while and generally be nice folk.'

  expected 'to be a responsible remote worker',
    'We expect our Live Services team to communicate more than anyone else in the business if they choose to work fully remote. Remote working requires extra attention to be paid to communication channels such as email and Slack.'

  expected 'to effectively juggle commitments',
    'We expect our Live Services team to be able to balance the priority of their work. Having an understanding of the severity of work along with expected time to fix is important and it should be used to help prioritise what to work on. Customer expectations need to be set and met. If they cannot be met they should be reset early and often.'
