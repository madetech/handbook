## Engineer Leadership

Traits recognise value that Engineers can provide customers and the company. They are hats and as Engineers develop their skills, Engineers will begin to wear more of those hats. Leadership is a quality that emerges out of individual traits. The longer an Engineer wears a trait the more of a leader in that area they will become.

Engineer Leadership is a property that emerges when an individual becomes a leader across multiple traits and starts to perform more vital roles within engagements with customers.

When an Engineer becomes a leader in +Customer and +Delivery they will naturally begin to be the primary point of contact with the customer for the engagement. As an Engineer gets more experience, their responsibilities will grow and their role in the team will evolve. Relationships will naturally develop between emerging leaders and customers as their seniority leads them to take more responsibility for the delivery and therefore will require them to be in contact with the customer more.

Our aim by introducing traits is to provide banners under which we can develop our skills and as leaders emerge we will call on these Engineers to take responsibility such as overall ownership of engagements and communication with customers.
