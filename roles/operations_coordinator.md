## Operations Coordinator Expectations

### To report on and maintain team utilisation at > 85%

We expect the Operations Coordinator to report on utilisation and maintain a schedule that supports 85% of the billable team capacity at Made Tech to be utilised on a weekly basis.

### To control resource allocation and forecasting across the organisation

We expect the Operations Coordinator to manage our engagements with third party contractors by ensuring they're accurately reporting and invoicing their time.

### To manage resource allocation with third party partners

We expect the Operations Coordinator to manage the need of third party resource with partner organisations. Where Made Tech are leading the delivery, the Operations Coordinator will ensure resource needs are met by third party partners.

### To identify and support team changes

We expect the Operations Coordinator to respond to and plan for upcoming team needs - such as new opportunities that need resourcing, existing deliveries that require increase or decrease in capacity, and the finishing of engagements. It is expected the Operations Coordinator will work with individual team members to make them proactively aware of potential team changes and to support the transition process.

We expect the Operations Coordinator to provide operational support to the Live Services team in order to ensure Reliability Engineers are scheduled against deliveries, that there is adequate interrupt cover, and that community of practice events such as retrospectives happen.

### To ensure we're accurately invoicing customers

We expect the Operations Coordinator to work with Delivery Leads weekly to ensure up to date and accurate records exist for all teams. Accurate customer invoicing relies on teams keeping accurate records of the time being spent against deliveries. Team utilisation and billing should be reported to the Management Team on a weekly basis.

### To deliver special projects

We expect the Operations Coordinator to deliver special projects such as the implementation of processes and tooling to track third party expenses.
