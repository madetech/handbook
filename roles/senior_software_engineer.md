# Senior Software Engineer

Our Senior Software Engineers create digital, data and technology outcomes that improve society. They do this by delivering and architecting software, and coaching others in public sector organisations to do the same.

## Your role at Made Tech

At Made Tech we want to positively impact the future of the country. We help public sector organisations deliver quality software to help citizens get more from public services. We work alongside brilliant public servants to modernise technology and accelerate digital delivery.

As a Senior Software Engineer you will combine your technical excellence, drive to deliver and coaching skills to achieve great outcomes for our clients and their users, and establish strong engineering cultures within organisations.

You will have the opportunity to work across a variety of technologies and will need to be comfortable doing so. Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular, C# with .NET Core, Java with Spring, Python with Django, and plenty more stacks. We don’t limit ourselves as a company to particular technologies and we expect all of our engineers to be keen on learning new skills.

High-performing software delivery teams need to be empowered to iteratively and rapidly deliver changes all the way through to production. To do this we combine our extensive cloud automation knowledge with DevOps culture.

We've been using AWS from the start and as Advanced Partners we’re go-to experts within the public sector. We use a range of IaaS, PaaS and FaaS depending on the needs of our users, in this case software teams, such as EC2, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes, Heroku, CloudFoundry, Azure App Services, and more. We use VPC and PrivateLink for connecting to on-premise, legacy systems. We also use API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, SES, RDS, and many other services provided by AWS. You will have the opportunity to use and learn these technologies. We also offer AWS and other cloud training.

We make sure we document our architecture and infrastructure as code, using technologies such as Terraform and OpenAPI. Containerisation is a big part of empowering our teams to develop, deploy and scale their applications, as is using AWS Lambda and avoiding the complexity of stateful services altogether. 

For us, DevOps is more about culture rather than roles and titles. Even though this role is for someone with strong DevOps experience, the biggest impact you will have is coaching and helping teams use the platforms you build. You won't be building infrastructure in isolation or charged with deploying other people’s work into production. You'll empower teams with the mantra, “you build it, you run it”!

We have a team of polyglot programmers (which you might already consider yourself to be), who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. You will need to be comfortable sharing your knowledge and skills with others. We’d love to hear some examples of where you’ve mentored, coached, and contributed to the growth of team members. Maybe you’ve written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two that you’d like to share.
