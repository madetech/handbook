# Reliability Engineer

Our support and reliability teams are responsible for our customers along with our customer's applications and infrastructure.

As an Reliability Engineer we expect someone:

## To be able to autonomously deliver working software

We expect our Reliability Engineers to be able to work on entire features, from conception through to production deployment, without guidance and direction from others. This doesn't mean they have to be delivered without pairing, or asking advice from the wider team. What it does mean is the primary force for ensuring the feature is built and deployed in a timely fashion is the responsiblity of the Reliability Engineer working on the problem.

## To be fully billable by timesheeting 7 hours daily

We expect our Reliability Engineers to ensure they are timesheeting 7 hours daily into harvest. As our current offering means we offer hours to our customers we need to make sure we are working through these hours and providing value to our customers.

## To be a responsible remote worker

We expect our Reliability Engineers to communicate more than anyone else in the business if they choose to work fully remote. Remote working requires extra attention to be paid to communication channels like email and slack.

## To be involved in practice improvement discussions

We expect everyone in our team to reflect on our practices and be a proactive voice in suggesting change. We expect you to be reflecting on your own development practices, reflecting on your team and the wider business.

## To be actively practicing TDD

We expect our engineering team to write tests first by default. We expect every feature to be tested. Every Pull Request (or equivalent chunk of work put up for peer review) must contain a test. If for some reason there are extenuating circumstances for not writing tests then more than one engineer should peer review and verify this.

## To be able to productively pair with their colleagues

We expect our engineering team to be friendly and lovely people to pair with. All pairing dynamics are different, sometimes you will be pairing with someone with less experience, sometimes you will have the same experience. Adjusting the speed of your work to accomodate for your pair is important and special care must be taken when mentoring/coaching those with less experience. No matter who you are pairing with you must take turns to compromise when your opinions differ.

## To be requesting peer reviews for the code they write

We expect our engineering team to always have their code peer reviewed at the least by one other person before merging. It's the responsibility of the code author to ask their colleagues to review and to merge the code in a timely fashion.

## To provide meaningful and considerate peer reviews for others

We expect our engineering team to provide feedback that makes code safer, easier to maintain and advances the knowledge of the original author. We expect everyone to negotiate and compromise when making a call on whether feedback should be addressed or not.

## To regularly communicate with customers without reminder

We expect our Reliability Engineers to be communicating with our customers when working through tasks on their behalf. A customer shouldn't need to ask for updates, we should be providing them in a timeley fashion. We should actively demonstrate our successes as much as possible to continue to build confidence with our customers.

## To keep their team updated on current work in progress

We expect our Reliability Engineers to keep their fellow team members up to date with their progress. A good litmus test for this is everyone on the team can describe what their team mates are up to.

## To effectively juggle commitments

We expect our Reliability Engineers to be able to balance the priority of their work. Having an understanding of the severity of work along with expected time to fix is important and it should be used to help prioritise what to work on. Customers expectations need to be set, met and if they cannot be met, be reset early and often.

## To provide an outstanding customer service

We expect our Reliability Engineers to be a delightly person to talk to for our customers. Our conversations should be professional and friendly, we should small talk where possible, use a smiley face once in a while and generally be nice folk.

## To proactively identify technical improvements and recommend them to customers

We expect our Reliability Engineers to be able to spot areas for improvement in customer codebases such as test suites, dependency upgrades, performance issues detected by monitoring. We also expect them to be able to highlight these issues in a jargon free way and be able to convey the relative urgency of the issues ultimately leading to our customer codebases being improved.
