# Academy Software Engineer

Being a software engineer at Made Tech is a great opportunity to surround yourself with people who care about the software they develop. Our 12 week Academy program gives you the skills you need to join one of our project delivery teams.

## Who is it for?

It's likely you will have already developed a love for programming, and you'll be convinced that a career in software development is where you want to go.

You may have taught yourself to code, been on a course or two, or have a degree in Computer Science. You can stitch some code together, but probably have no commercial experience.
