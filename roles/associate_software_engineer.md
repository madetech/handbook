# Associate Software Engineer

Our engineers build software that makes our clients happy. They prefer problem solving over completing tasks, love learning from colleagues, and work as a unified team to help deliver projects that make a real difference to people’s lives. 

## Your role at Made Tech

We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery, making sure our clients’ goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.

Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, and C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves and we expect all of our engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there’s a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release. We’re usually responsible for setting up clients’ infrastructure, too. For example, on AWS, GCP or Azure using tools like Terraform. Though, sometimes we opt for a Platform as a Service like Heroku.

## What experience are we looking for?

All of our Software Engineers are trained first as an Academy Software Engineer within our 12-week academy programme. 

## Work perks and benefits

Take a look at the Benefits & Perks section of the [Made Tech Handbook](https://github.com/madetech/handbook) to see what we can offer you.

## Salary and location

We mainly work remotely but you may need to visit clients or go to the office occasionally. We have offices in London, Bristol, Manchester, and Swansea. 

The salary for this role is location dependant:

- UK: £27,750 - £45,000
- London & South East: £29,137 - £47,250

## Applying

We don't hire directly for Associate Software Engineer roles at Made Tech. We prioritise our hiring opportunities towards our Software Engineering Academy. You’ll need to complete our 12-week academy programme. After your first 6 months at Made Tech, you’ll be in a position to pass probation and become an Associate Software Engineer with us. Learn more about our academy and find out when we’re accepting applications at https://www.madetech.com/careers/academy. We’d still love to hear from you if you feel our academy or more senior engineering roles aren’t a good fit for you. If you have any questions, drop us a line at [careers@madetech.com](mailto:careers@madetech.com).
