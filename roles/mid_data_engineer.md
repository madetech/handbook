# Data Engineer

Our Data Engineers enable public sector organisations to embrace a data-driven approach by providing data platforms and services that are high-quality, cost-efficient, and tailored to the clients’ needs. They develop, operate, and maintain these services. They make sure they provide maximum value to data consumers, including analysts, scientists, and business stakeholders.

## Your role at Made Tech
