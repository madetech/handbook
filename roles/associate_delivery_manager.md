# Associate Delivery Manager

**You’ll work as part of a delivery team. You’ll provide administrative and delivery assistance so the team can deliver to their full potential, while you develop the skills of a Delivery Manager.**

## Your role at Made Tech

As an Associate Delivery Manager, you will work alongside a more senior delivery manager, shadowing and providing support, until you’re confident enough to deliver an element yourself under guidance and mentorship. You will pair with the Delivery Manager and observe how they triage and solve problems, to provide you with confidence and experience to move into an autonomous delivery role.
Although you will probably not have experience managing software delivery, you’ll use cross-functional skills to support your delivery team. Initially you will expect the majority of your tasks to be directed by your delivery partner, but you will start to identify items you can support autonomously during team ceremonies and sprint planning.

You use empathy and effective listening skills to help the team collaborate. You will use your previous project management experience to support the identification and management of project dependencies, risks and issues alongside your delivery lead. After observing team ceremonies and building relationships with the client stakeholders, you will start to take responsibility for running meetings, answering client questions and unblocking team problems.

With support, you will use your excellent attention to detail to ensure the project is delivered within budget, using tools such as Google Sheets to match up the time spent by the team with the amount of work left to complete.
You are passionate about learning and developing your skill set, and are an active member of the Delivery Community of Practice (COP). You spend time learning from other Capabilities (cloud & engineering, user-centred design, product & business analysis) about what good looks like in their areas of expertise.
