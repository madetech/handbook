# Associate Delivery Manager

**Work as part of a Delivery Team, providing administrative and delivery assistance to support the team deliver at their full potential whilst developing the skills of a Delivery Manager.**

Manchester, London, and Bristol UK.

Please apply for this role at [www.madetech.com/careers](https://www.madetech.com/careers).

## What does the job entail?

As an Associate Delivery Manager, you will work alongside a more senior delivery manager, shadowing and providing support, until confident enough to deliver an element themselves under guidance and mentorship. You will pair with the Delivery Manager and observe how they triage and solve problems, to provide you with confidence and experience to move into an autonomous delivery role. 

Although you will probably not have experience managing software delivery, you’ll use cross-functional skills to support your delivery team. Initially you will expect the majority of your tasks to be directed by your Delivery partner, but you will start to identify items you can support autonomously during team ceremonies and sprint planning. 

You use empathy and effective listening to help the team collaborate. You will use your previous project management experience to support the identification and management of project dependencies, risks and issues alongside your Delivery Lead. After observing team ceremonies and building relationships with the client stakeholders, you will start to take responsibility for running meetings, answering client questions and unblocking tram problems. 

With support, you will use your excellent attention to detail to ensure the project is delivered within budget, using tools such as Google Sheets to match up the time spent by the team with the amount of work left to complete.

You are passionate about learning and developing your skill set, so are an active member of the Delivery Community of Practice (COP), and spend time learning from other Capabilities (Cloud & Engineering, User Centred Design, Product & Business Analysis) about what good looks like in their areas of expertise.
