# Product Manager

Our Product Managers are accountable for the quality of complex, high-risk products and services in the public sector and work with stakeholders and teams to set visions and priorities. 

They represent the user and work with the team to ensure what we build achieves the outcomes we desire. They have strong communication skills and are comfortable engaging with senior stakeholders from a consultancy perspective.

## Your role at Made Tech

Our Product Managers are expected to work across the whole digital service delivery team, engaging regularly with the client, 3rd parties and contractors as needed to ensure that the team's effort delivers value to the end users and the client's organisation and that the project is delivered successfully. A core value of MadeTech is to enable the entire team (client and MadeTech) to rapidly evolve into a single high performance team that is effectively embedded within the client's organisation. You must have client-facing experience and a proven track record of working with customers to define a prioritised backlog. We'll want to discuss previous prioritisation methods you have been a part of, including how you helped to distil key client goals into epics and user stories. You’ll achieve this through:

- Effective workshop facilitation, enabling the delivery team to interpret research outcomes into actionable insights, continued by using product management principles and approaches to define what is built meeting user, service and organisation needs, alongside understanding and experience of agile methodology and how to apply the agile mindset to all aspects of their work.
- Ensuring that the outcomes of any engagement have identifiable outcomes that are measurable and deliver value to the user and our client.
- Positioning yourself at the center of a multidisciplinary team, typically managing large scale projects with multiple workstreams, right from the discovery phase. During discovery, which normally takes 1-2 weeks, you will use the customer's high-level business goals to create the product roadmap. You will work with a range of stakeholders, including the delivery managers, software engineers, client, third-party services and Discovery Team, to identify and remove blockers, whilst empowering the delivery teams to decide on best practice and design epics/user stories to work from.
- Ensuring roadmaps are prioritised by business value and risk you will ensure our delivery teams are able to ship a first release within 12 weeks and continue to ship daily from then on. We aim to always delight our customers with the quality of service that can be delivered within their budget.
- Working with the delivery manager to accurately monitor the progress of a project. That will include accessible weekly and monthly dashboards that can be fed back to the relevant stakeholders, including Directors. These will incorporate budget requirements and outcomes as well as outlining blockers and risks. 
- Focusing on improving the delivery team's ability to meet deadlines and adhere to the roadmap by diplomatically protecting them from outside influences and unnecessary distractions, instead, engaging the teams with the clients in more structured processes such as workshops, sprint planning, daily scrums, show and tells, retros, etc.

## In the application process the following skills will be assessed but if you don’t have everything on this list, please still apply

While we will look for you to have experience in these things, if you don’t have one of these don’t let that stop you applying.

- Working directly with clients, ideally in a Consultancy with multiple services
- In-depth knowledge and experience of Lean and Agile processes 
- Able to support team overcoming constraints to become high performing
- Designing, facilitating and leading workshops to shape vision and set direction
- Working within multidisciplinary teams with product, design, and technology working within the same cycles

- Evidence of self-development – we value keen learners
- Drive to deliver outcomes for users
- Desire to mentor others

- Assist sales and marketing team with product knowledge

Communication will be key to your success, so you should feel comfortable presenting to senior stakeholders in a professional manner, so that the needs of everyone involved in a project are kept in balance, whilst mediating disputes when required.

## We want our teams to grow. If you don’t already have the following skills, you will have access to a learning budget, experienced team members and a wider learning and mentoring culture that can help you develop the following:

Don’t forget to mention any of the experience listed below. While it’s optional, it’s all highly desired!

- Writing blog posts and giving talks
- User research planning and execution
- User testing planning and execution
- Agile estimation/Sprint planning & story definition
- Service design
- UI/UX Interaction design
- User Centred Design (UCD)

Whilst we are an agile software development company and truly believe in the benefits of an agile mindset, we are also aware that not all companies have bought into the process to the same extent. As a result, you will need to be flexible in adapting to meet the specific needs of each client and we will want to hear about times that you have applied that flexibility previously, and the benefits that it brought.

## What you will get from the role

You will contribute to the product function of a company that is rapidly scaling to meet increased customer demand, giving you exposure to a huge variety of enterprise-level, highly complex programmes with ever evolving challenges, whilst getting to work with public sector organisations.

Made Tech will provide you the opportunity to use the most exciting new technologies and to work in an environment where we are always striving to stay on the cutting-edge of market trends and processes.

You'll have the chance to develop and adapt our agile processes, learning and contributing to both internal and external teams on best practice.

Finally, as we continue to grow rapidly there are many opportunities to progress within the company. The role could develop in a delivery focused direction, or transition towards agile coaching (either internally or externally), or promotion to Senior Product Manager – we're happy to support you to take charge of your future and follow your passions!
