# Data Scientist

Our Data Scientists enable public sector organisations to unlock the value and the potential of their data, extracting insights and helping organisations to make informed decisions. They collaborate closely with our clients in all aspects of the project - from understanding the data, to interpreting model's output and model deployment. They seek to provide reliable answers and deliver maximum value to stakeholders.

## Your role at Made Tech
At Made Tech we want to positively impact the future of the government by using technology to improve society, for everyone. We want to empower the public sector to deliver and continuously improve digital services that are user-centric, data-supported and freed from legacy technology.

As as Data Scientist, you will be a key member of the data team, working closely with data engineers to interrogate client data, performing exploratory data analysis, designing feature transformations and building robust machine learning models.

On occasion, you may even play the role of advisor, educating clients on data science processes and aiding in the upskilling of client analysts. 

As a member of the Data Practice at Made Tech, you will expected to help build our thriving data community, hosting talks, participating in discussions and presenting new and interesting concepts to both the Data group and the wider company.

You’ll need to have a drive to deliver outcomes for our clients. You should be comfortable sharing your existing knowledge keen to learn more. We'd love to hear some examples of times you’ve mentored, coached, and contributed to the growth of team members.
