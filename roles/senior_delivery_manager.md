**Successfully leading digital projects to ensure that our clients get great experiences and outcomes, and our teams deliver at their full potential.**

Manchester, London, and Bristol UK.

Please apply for this role at [www.madetech.com/careers](https://www.madetech.com/careers).

## What does the job entail?

Senior Delivery Managers are accountable for successful project delivery. Normally working within one or two teams, you will promote effective cross-functional delivery by building motivated, collaborative delivery teams. You will probably be using Agile methodologies, with additional processes for managing dependencies, supporting risk mitigation and resolution and managing the project scope and budget. 

You will work as part of a cross functional delivery team, which may include client stakeholders and partner agencies. You will personify servant leadership, promoting a collaborative approach to ensure the project delivers the desired outcomes for users and customers, working together to identify and manage risks and issues that arise. You will be empowered to solve problems that arise independently, but will be supported by a Lead or Principal Delivery Manager where required. You will build effective working relationships with client stakeholders, and are the go to person for questions about the delivery. 

You will have a good understanding of Agile Delivery, and be able to work with a team and client stakeholders to determine the delivery methodology that will best work with the needs of the project (for example Scrum, or Kanban). You will inspire trust with stakeholders , to guide clients throughout the delivery process, using your influence to continuously iterate and approve team processes. You will work with a Product Manager to define and deliver against a Roadmap, in order to monitor whether the project is on track and support conversations about priority, scope and budget. 

You understand that you will get out what you put into the organisation you work in, so you look for ways to contribute to Made Tech beyond the scope of your delivery. This could include participating in and contributing to the Delivery Community of Practice (COP), managing the performance and development of a number of Delivery Managers and supporting recruitment activities. You may also contribute to other areas of the business, for example Learning and Development or Marketing.
