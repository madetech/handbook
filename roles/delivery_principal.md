Our Delivery Principal help public sector organisations accelerate digital delivery, drive efficiency and ultimately improve society.

## What does the job entail?

At Made Tech we want to positively impact the future of the country by using technology to improve society.

As a Delivery Principal you will be accountable for the successful delivery of a number of workstreams / teams within an account. You will focus on delivery assuring and supporting the teams, with emphasis on solving the difficult problems together with your teams, uncovering risks before they materialise and ensuring our deliveries adhere to the Made Tech delivery principles & standards. The teams will usually consist of a Delivery Manager, a Tech Lead and a number of engineers and although you will not be running the delivery day-to-day, you will assume the overall accountability at the account level and for all the workstreams within your account.

You will be expected to maintain a broad knowledge of modern software delivery practices, be able to articulate benefits and debate use of different modern software development practices, and you will be expected to share this with both the wider customer and Made Tech businesses. 

Working closely with our customers' senior leadership you will help inform their strategy and ensure our teams are delivering to a high quality and are aligned to our customers vision and goals. As part of an account team, alongside Tech and Client Leads, you will help shape account plans and be responsible for delivering against them. Working with Made Tech's regional and group leadership you will ensure our work with customers is aligned to our growth goals and you will play a pivotal role in identifying new opportunities and winning work. 

You will coach and support our Delivery Managers to steer their team's towards success. You will also be responsible for hiring and line managing Delivery Managers in your regions.

As a delivery leader within Made Tech you will be expected to maintain and grow your professional network. You will be expected to contribute to thought leadership, content and events and ideally, you will have a proven track record of doing so.
