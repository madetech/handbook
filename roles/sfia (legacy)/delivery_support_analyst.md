## Your role at Made Tech
The Delivery Support Analyst in PMO at Made Tech plays an essential role in ensuring the seamless execution and oversight of the company's digital transformation engagements. 

This role will see you managing workstream reporting, ensuring compliance with Statements of Work (SoW), and maintaining a comprehensive RAID (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies) log across all Made Tech engagements. 

This involves capturing and managing the demand for resources within each workstream or SoW, coordinating with the Scheduling team to raise and manage resource requests, and working closely with workstream leads to ensure the appropriate allocation of resources. 

The Delivery Support Analyst will play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and efficiency of the project lifecycle. 

The Delivery Support Analyst supports the account onboarding of new team members and supports the creation of rotation plans as necessary, ensuring smooth transitions and consistent team performance within the PMO office. 

The Delivery Support Analyst also tracks budgets and capacity within each workstream or SoW, actively highlighting risks and issues to the accountable Delivery Manager, which is vital for maintaining project alignment with financial and operational goals. 

Furthermore, this role ensures accurate and timely completion of timesheets across all workstreams, which is essential for effective budget management and resource planning. 

The management of team work plans, schedules, and on-site registers also falls under the PMO's purview, allowing for the consistent and organised execution of projects.

Beyond operational management support, the Delivery Support Analyst at Made Tech is responsible for producing timely, visual, and client-ready reports on all aspects of the engagements. 

These reports are crucial for communicating the current status, risks, and progress to various stakeholders, including the C-Suite, ensuring transparency and informed decision-making. 

The Delivery Support Analyst also supports the team with logistical tasks, such as booking travel and accommodation, facilitating key meetings and ceremonies with stakeholders, and overseeing dependencies and issue monitoring. 

These activities contribute to the overall health and success of the workstreams and SoWs, allowing the PMO office to play an integral role in maintaining project momentum and resolving challenges as they arise.

The Delivery Support Analyst also plays an active role in presenting and reporting on engagement status at agreed frequency levels to a wide range of stakeholders across the business.

Finally, the Delivery Support Analyst creates and maintains all key engagement documentation, or collaborates with the Delivery Manager to bring in additional expertise when needed. 

This documentation is vital for keeping a detailed and organised record of project activities, decisions, and changes. 

As an active participant in the Delivery Management community, this role not only helps to drive the successful delivery of current engagements but also contributes to the continuous improvement of project management practices within Made Tech, ensuring that the organisation remains agile, efficient, and responsive to client needs.
