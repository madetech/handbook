# Principal Security Engineer

Our Principal Security Engineers enable public sector organisations to mitigate cyber and information security risks across an increasingly complex and threatened mix of technology-enabled services. They provide senior security leadership and support to our clients and teams, build and manage key relationships with clients, manage security and risk across one or more accounts, and support sales.

## Your role at Made Tech

At Made Tech we want to positively impact the future of the country by using technology to improve society, for everyone. We want to empower the public sector to deliver and continuously improve digital services that are user-centric, data-driven and freed from legacy technology. Underpinning this is a need for us to do this securely, handling public data safely, and defending against increasing cyber and information security risks.

As a Principal Security Engineer you will work closely with our clients’ senior leadership to help inform their security strategy and to make sure our teams are delivering secure digital services and cloud-based platforms, aligned to our clients’ risk tolerance. Working alongside delivery, client and other capability principals, you will help shape account plans and be responsible for delivering against them.

Working with Made Tech's leadership you will make sure our work with customers is aligned to our growth goals and you will play a pivotal role in identifying new opportunities and winning work. Running bid teams, supporting sales teams and developing new business is critical to this role.

You’ll need to have a drive to deliver outcomes for users and have a desire to mentor teams. You will coach and support Lead Security Engineers to steer their teams towards success. You will also be responsible for hiring and line managing Lead Security Engineers.

While this is not a hands-on coding technical role, the importance of credibility in internet-era approaches to digital, data and technology in the public sector cannot be understated. You will be expected to maintain a broad technical knowledge of modern cyber security practices, be able to shape security strategy and roadmaps, and hold others to account for technical quality.

As a security leader within Made Tech you will be expected to maintain and grow your professional network. You will be expected to contribute to thought leadership, content and events and should have a proven track record of doing so.
