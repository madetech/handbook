# Senior Data Engineer

Our Senior Data Engineers enable public sector organisations to embrace a data-driven approach by providing data platforms and services that are high-quality, cost-efficient, and tailored to clients’ needs. They develop, operate, and maintain these services, as well as ensuring they provide maximum value to data consumers, including analysts, scientists, and business stakeholders.

## Your role at Made Tech 

At Made Tech we want to positively impact the future of the country by using technology to improve society, for everyone. We want to empower the public sector to deliver and continuously improve digital services that are user-centric, data-driven and freed from legacy technology. A key component of this is developing modern data systems and platforms that drive informed decision-making for our clients. You will also work closely with clients to help shape their data strategy.

As a Senior Data Engineer, you may play one or more roles according to our clients' needs. Sometimes the role is very hands-on and you'll support in a senior contributor role for a project, focusing on both delivering engineering work as well as upskilling members of the client team. At other points, you might play more of a technical architect role. 

You’ll need to have a drive to deliver outcomes for users. You’ll make sure that the wider context of a delivery is considered and maintain alignment between the operational and analytical aspects of the engineering solution.

As a senior member of the data capability within Made Tech, you will also participate in our hiring process and continued development of the team, as well as representing us internally, and publicly via presentations. You will also line-manage members of the team up to the mid level.

You will need to be comfortable sharing your knowledge and skills with others. We'd love to hear some examples of times you’ve mentored, coached, and contributed to the growth of team members. Maybe you’ve written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two that you’d like to share.
