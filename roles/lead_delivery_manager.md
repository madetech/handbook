# Lead Delivery Manager

**Successfully leading complex digital projects to ensure that our clients get great experiences and outcomes, and our teams deliver at their full potential.**

Manchester, London, and Bristol UK.

Please apply for this role at [www.madetech.com/careers](https://www.madetech.com/careers).

## What does the job entail?

Lead Delivery Managers are accountable for successful project delivery in a complex environment. This might mean a small, but complex delivery involving a lot of consultancy such as a Policy Focused Discovery; a larger delivery programme with several delivery teams; or multiple small, less complex engagements. 

You will work as part of a cross-functional delivery team, which might include client stakeholders and partner agencies. You will personify servant leadership, promoting a collaborative approach to ensure projects deliver the desired outcomes for users and customers, working together to identify and manage risks and issues that arise. Depending on the size of the account you are working in, you may be the most senior line of project escalation - or you may work closely with a Delivery Principal as part of a wider programme. 

While you are an expert in Agile Delivery, you are also pragmatic and understand that other Delivery Approaches may be more appropriate for a specific situation when working  in consultancy and the public sector. Therefore you will define the delivery approach and team shape collectively with the team and client stakeholders. You will inspire trust with senior stakeholders and guide and coach clients throughout the delivery process, using your influence to continuously iterate and approve team processes.  You will be able to support Product Managers with defining and delivering against a Roadmap, in order to monitor whether the project is on track and facilitate conversations about backlog priority, scope and budget. 

As a Delivery Leader, you will contribute to Made Tech beyond the scope of your delivery. This will include participating in and contributing to the Delivery Community of Practice (COP), managing the performance and development of a number of Delivery Managers and supporting recruitment activities. You should also start to contribute to growing Made Tech‚Äôs impact, for example through maintaining and growing your professional network; contributing to thought leadership, content and events; identifying sales opportunities within the account you are working in; or taking part in the sales bid process.
