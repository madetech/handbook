# Senior Software Engineer 2

(Often advertised as Lead Software Engineer.)

Our Senior Engineer 2s turn our customer’s needs into roadmaps, coach teams to deliver, are cutting the best code of their career, still learn every day, and constantly strive to be nice humans.

## What does the job entail?

We primarily write and deliver custom software to our customers. Before a project kicks off we will have a number of sessions where we begin to understand the customer’s business and what they are looking to achieve. We then formulate a roadmap for them, potentially a business case too, before starting delivery.

We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. We work across central and local government, as well as in health, and our past lies in the technology startup world. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery; ensuring our customer’s goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.

Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release. Also, we will usually be responsible for setting up a customer’s infrastructure too! Such as on AWS, GCP or Azure using a tool like Terraform, though sometimes we opt for a Platform as a Service like Heroku.

We grow a team of polyglot programmers, which you might already consider yourself to be, who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. To create this environment our Senior Engineers need to embrace sharing their knowledge and skills with others, and they need to keep an open mind – we’d love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two.
