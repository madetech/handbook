# Company Credit Cards

We don't want to approve every company purchase. We would rather trust people to make reasonable spending decisions than assume people will abuse the privilege by default.

We offer all our full time staff a company credit card, which can be used for discretionary spending. If you want a book, some software or you just want to go to a conference, it is on us. We just ask you to be reasonable with your spending.

Here's some examples of things people have purchased:

- Books for work (programming, best practice, sales, etc.)
- Computer equipment (new monitor, keyboard, HDMI adapters, etc.)
- Amenities for the office (coffee, fruit, biscuits, etc.)
- Lunch and drinks for a customer
- Taxi to and from the office for a meeting
- Taxi home after working late
- Stationary (post-it notes, notepads, etc.)
- Conference tickets (speak with a Director or Line Manager if over Â£150 per ticket)

If you would like a credit card, [download this form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7Zb_9JeCVRkRUlFQWdEVmpEWlE/view?usp=sharing), fill in the first page and email a copy to [Rory](mailto:rory@madetech.com).

## Receipts

It's important that we can distinguish between personal payments and payments issued through company credit cards. To help us to do this, can you send all receipts (they must be VAT receipts) for purchases made on credit cards to `card-receipts@madetech.co.uk`.

Expenses that you've paid for personally, should be put into Xero using the [expenses process](../guides/compensation/expenses.md).
