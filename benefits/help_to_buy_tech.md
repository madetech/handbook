# Help to buy Tech is now SMART Tech!

We've signed up to Smart Tech within the Made Tech Benefits box to make it easier and more affordable for our team to buy the latest tech gadgets.

Smart Tech lets you get the latest tech, such as Smart Phones, Smart Watches and/or Game Consoles, up to a maximum value £2,000. You apply for an e-voucher worth the value of your shopping basket - so decide what you want to buy before you apply for this perk.
You then repay this amount via your salary across 12 or 18 months.

### 12. How do I request a refund?
If you’ve not viewed the voucher and it’s been less than 14 days since you ordered it, it’s really simple. Just head on over to order history and click request refund. This will automatically cancel your deductions so you won’t make any payments from your salary for it. If your payroll has already been run you may have one deduction taken, but fear not, your finance team will be told the exact amount to refund you in your next pay.
If you’ve viewed your voucher or it’s past 14 days you need to contact the Made Tech Benefits box employee heldesk, who will contact Currys to confirm the voucher has not been used. Once it has been confirmed we’ll refund the voucher, notify you and contact your employer to let them know to stop your deductions and how much you are due back.
If you’ve used your voucher, you cannot get a refund unless you are refunded by Currys. Normally they’ll give you a new gift card, we’ll need you to supply us with the new gift card number (the long number) where we will then contact Currys and check that the new voucher has not been used and follow the usual process.
Refunds generally take between 3-5 working days to confirm, this period can take longer depending on the complexity of the enquiry.

### 13. Can the price of my tech differ from SmartTech™ and Currys PC World?
The SmartTech™ catalogue is updated daily with items, their prices, and availability coming directly from Currys PC World, however, there may be the odd occasion when a price you see in the SmartTech™ catalogue is different from what you see with Currys PC World. In the rare event of this happening, it’s because the price will have been recently changed by Currys PC World and it takes our catalogue 24-hours to update. If you want to be absolutely sure then we recommend double-checking the price at Currys PC World by following the link attached to each product. If you already have your voucher and see a difference in price, don’t worry, you can always use the voucher in conjunction with cash, as well as being able to use any money left on the voucher at a later date.
