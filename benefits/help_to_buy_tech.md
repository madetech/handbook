# Help to buy Tech

We've signed up to Techscheme to make it easier and more affordable for our team to buy the latest tech gadgets.

Techscheme lets you get the latest tech, such as Smart Phones, Smart Watches and/or Game Consoles, up to a maximum value £2,000. You apply for an e-voucher worth the value of your shopping basket - so decide what you want to buy before you apply for this perk.
You then repay this amount via your salary across 12 or 24 months. Essentially you will be giving up part of gross taxable income which means you don't pay National Insurance contributions - this results in a saving of up to 12% too (depending on your tax rate). 
Best of all – you own the products from the beginning and there’s no end of hire fee.

You can calculate your savings by using their [calculator](https://www.techscheme.co.uk/how-it-works)

## Process for buying tech products

- Available once you have passed probation
- Pick your tech products from [Apple](https://www.apple.com) or [Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/index.html)
- Work out how much you want to spend - up to £2,000
- Visit: https://www.techscheme.co.uk/eb76a9
- Fill out the request form - you will need your payroll number 
- Once your certificate has been requested let a director know so they can find the email and approve it
- Techscheme.co.uk will then generate and send an invoice to one of the directors (this will take some time, potentially a few days)
- Once the invoice has been paid, download your certificate/provide it to the chosen retailer
- Enjoy your Tech products!
