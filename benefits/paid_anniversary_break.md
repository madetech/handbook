# Paid anniversary break

You deserve a break! We encourage a healthy work life balance and our flexible holiday goes a long way.

To really push this further, and to say a huge thank you for being with us, we will treat you and family to a paid holiday - its on us!

## After your 3 year anniversary 
You are treated to a two week paid break (14 days)
* For a family (two adults and up to 2 children)
* Flights + Accommodation = up to £2,500 + costs for children under 16 
* Spending money = £1,000 + budget for children (up to £400 per child)

## After your 5 year anniversary 
You are treated to a four week paid break (28 days)
* For a family (two adults and up to 2 children)
* Flights + Accommodation = £4,500 + costs for children under 16
* Spending money = £2,500 + budget for children (up to £950 per child)

(There will be an extra budget if you bring your children along.)

## COVID-19
Given the nature of the pandemic, we're offering an alternative to the paid anniversary break.

You can opt to take the break as a bonus, paid at £3500 for three years or £7000 for five years. Please note that this will be paid as net income and subject to tax.

You can delay taking and using your holiday benefit for up to 12 months after your anniversary date, though we would consider extending this based on how long you've been subject to local travel restrictions.

Please let the people team know what you'd like to do if you will be eligible for either benefit during travel restrictions.
