# Friday Lunchers

Every Friday we select five people from each region to have a team lunch and join any new starters from that week. This weekly ritual provides an opportunity for the team to socialise and share their successes and challenges from the week that's passed. It's important that we continue to set aside the time for this, especially when as many of us work remotely most of the time.

## How it works

The people team will organise one lunch for each region. You can only expense your lunch if invited to do so by them.

While we're working remotely, order from your favourite restaurant, or purchase ingredients from a supermarket (up to a maximum of Â£20) and expense back under the "Staff Meals" section on Xero.

If you have any questions, ask the people or finance team.
