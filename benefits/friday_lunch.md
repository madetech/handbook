FRIDAY LUNCHERS

>Every Friday we select five people from each region to have a team lunch and join any new starters from that week. This weekly ritual provides an opportunity for the team to socialise and share their successes and challenges from the week that's passed. It's important that we continue to set aside the time for this, especially when we're all working remotely.

**How it works:**

The People team will organise one lunch each region: you can only expense your lunch if invited to do so by them.

While we're working remotely, order from your favourite restaurant, or purchase ingredients from a supermarket (up to a maximum of £20) and expense back under the "Staff Meals" section on Xero.

Any questions, ask the People or Finance teams.
