# Friday Lunch & Drinks

Every Friday we'll pay for a team lunch and post-work drinks. 

This weekly ritual provides an opportunity for the team to socialise and share their successes and challenges from the week that's passed. It's important that we continue to set aside the time for this, especially when we have teams working at customers offices regularly.

Few rules:

* One of the directors will pick-up the tab for lunch. If we're not around, somebody with a company card should be able to cover lunch, or it can be put through as an expense claim.

* Whoever is involved in organising team lunch is responsible for ensuring that it is an inclusive activity for all of the team. 

* We trust people to use their judgement as to what is a reasonable amount to spend on a team lunch.

* Where possible, encourage customers to join us for lunch and / or drinks. 

* When going for Friday drinks, we'll cover the tab whilst one of the directors is around (and offering to pay). After that, you'll be on your own and drinks should come out of your own pocket.

* We encourage you to invite friends of Made Tech and people we might consider hiring to Friday drinks. It's a good opportunity to meet both socially.
