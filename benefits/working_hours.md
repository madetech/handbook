# Working Hours

We care more about the quality of the work we produce than the amount of hours worked. We believe we individually know how we work best and can therefore set our own hours.

## Some things to note

**Setting hours** - We don’t have a set amount of hours you need to work in a day or a week. Many of us will vary our hours day to day while others prefer routine.

**Start time** - We don’t have a specific start time but we do have our company update on the first Wednesday of every month at 9:30am, and weekly Friday showcases at 4:30pm. You should be in the office or dial in remotely for these meetings.

**Ending your day** - There isn't a time we expect everyone to switch off their laptop or leave the office. If you're working shorter hours but having problems delivering on your commitments, someone is more likely to check in with you to see if everythings OK, and provide offers of support or some constructive feedback.

**Longer hours** - The reality of working closely with clients is that there are deadlines. Sometimes working longer to make sure of a smooth launch or to help diagnose and fix a problem is needed. But we do everything we can to make sure these occasions are rare. If you regularly feel this pressure, say more than twice a year, we encourage you to raise this with a manager or another team member.

**Other team member hours** - You might also feel pressure if you notice other team members regularly seem to work longer hours than you. We suggest finding ways to share and receive open and honest feedback. Unless someone has raised an issue with you, everything’s probably fine.

**Commitments** - We need to respect our commitments and the time of other team members. If a meeting is scheduled, we ask everyone to be as accommodating as they can. This isn't to say you can't be responsible for setting meeting times that fit your working style better.

**Contractual hours** - Most of our employment contracts do have set contractual hours. This is because we have a billed delivery operating model with clients that’s based on hours worked. This also helps us to adjust our flexible working policy in case that’s ever needed.
