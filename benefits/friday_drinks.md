# Friday Drinks

Every Friday we'll pay for post-work drinks. This weekly ritual provides an opportunity for the team to socialise.

As drinking is exclusionary in nature to those who don't like or can't be around alcohol we make efforts to make sure it's not the center of our culture whilst at the same time acknowledging it's important to some.

Few rules:

* When going for Friday drinks, we'll cover the tab whilst one of the directors is around (and offering to pay). After that, you'll be on your own and drinks should come out of your own pocket.

* Remember you're still representing the business when you are out drinking. Be respectful and decent at all times.

* Where possible, encourage customers to join us for drinks. 

* We encourage you to invite friends of Made Tech and people we might consider hiring to Friday drinks. It's a good opportunity to meet both socially.
