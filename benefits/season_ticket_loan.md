# Season Ticket Loan

On completion of the probation period, we offer a season ticket loan up to the value of one month's net salary.

You will need to provide a receipt for the season ticket.

The loan will be repaid automatically at PAYE from your net salary every month. There is no tax benefit, and no interest is payable.

If you leave the company prior to your loan being repaid, the outstanding balance will be deducted from your final salary payment.
