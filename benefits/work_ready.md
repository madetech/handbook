# Work Ready

We know you're ready to work and so we want you to be work ready. We'll [equip you](../guides/it/Hardware.md) with a Macbook (or a PC if you're in Engineering or UCP and would prefer that) which will arrive at your home address prior to your start date.

In addition to this, you have access to a one off £250 work ready allowance. The allowance allows you to purchase items that will assist you in your job role whilst working away from the office. It can be used from your first day, and doesn’t need to be used in one go. If you are working your notice period, you are unable to use the budget. 

Before utilising your work ready budget, please complete your DSE (Display screen equipment) training and DSE assessment to assist you in purchasing items required to fit in with DSE requirements.

The work ready budget can only be claimed in Made Benefits - our dedicated benefits app platform. 

Each team member is assigned a virtual card on Made Benefits pre-loaded with their work ready allowance. This virtual card can be used to make eligible purchases directly through the platform.

Examples of things you can order:

- Monitor
- Adapters (HDMI, USBC, etc.)
- Keyboards
- Mice
- Ergonomic chairs
- Standing desks
- Headphones
- Laptop stand
- Docking station
- Extension lead
- Laptop sleeve

Please order items that are dispatched from the UK. If items are dispatched from outside of the UK you could receive a duty and tax bill that will also have to be deducted from your WFH budget.

If you are unable to claim items back yourself, please contact the operations team on either [operations@madetech.com](mailto:operations@madetech.com) or through [Ask Made Tech](https://askmadetech.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb) (internal link).
