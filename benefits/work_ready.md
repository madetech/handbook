# Work Ready

We know you're ready to work and so we want you to be work ready. We'll equip you with a brand new Macbook, monitor, keyboard, adapters, and whatever other technical equipment you need to do your job. If you want a book, some software or you just want to go to a conference, it is on us. We just ask you to be reasonable with your spending.

Here's some examples of things people have purchased:

- Books for work (programming, best practice, sales, etc.)
- New monitor
- Home office equipment
- Adapters (HDMI, USB, etc.)
- Keyboards
- Ergonomic chairs, stools, stands
- Standing desks
- Conference tickets
- Training (AWS, domain-driven design, marketing, etc.)

## Expenses

Expenses that you've paid for personally, should be put into Xero using the [expenses process](../guides/compensation/expenses.md).
