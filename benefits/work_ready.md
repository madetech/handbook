# Work Ready

**Work Ready Budget Policy**
From your first day at Made Tech, you have a £250 Work Ready allowance. This budget is strictly intended for essential equipment to equip yourself to be able to work from a client, Made Tech, or home office. It doesn't need to all be used in one go - you can come back and use the remaining budget when you need to.

** Mandatory prerequisites**
Before utilising this budget, you must complete your DSE (Display Screen Equipment) training and assessment via iHASCO. This ensures your purchases align with health and safety requirements for your specific setup.

**Eligible items (work-related only)**
This budget is for equipment that directly facilitates your work/daily tasks. Examples include:
Visual/tech: External monitors, laptop stands, adapters (HDMI, USB-C).
Peripherals: Keyboards, mice, webcams.
Ergonomics: Ergonomic chairs, stools, standing desks.
Audio/Power: Headsets for calls, extension leads.
Protection: Laptop bags/sleeves, privacy screens.


** Ineligible Items (non-work expenses)**
To maintain the integrity of this benefit, the budget cannot be used for general household, lifestyle, or comfort items, including but not limited to:
Food/Drink: Coffee machines, kettles, snacks etc.
Decor: Plants, rugs, art etc.
General furniture: Sofas, armchairs, side tables etc.
Utilities: Bills, heating equipment, streaming subscriptions etc.
Non-work tech: Personal mobile phones, tablets, TVs etc.

Note: If you are unsure whether an item is eligible, please get in touch with the Business Operations team by submitting a request through Ask Made Tech for pre-approval before purchasing. Unauthorised or non-compliant purchases may result in a declined expense or a request for reimbursement to the company.

**How to purchase**
Happl Card: Purchase equipment directly via the Made Benefits platform using the virtual card on the Work Ready Budget page.
Personal card: If you use your own card, submit the expense via Xero.
Amazon orders: You must upload the final VAT invoice (available after delivery), not the order confirmation receipt.

Security reminder: To prevent unauthorised charges, do not save the virtual card as a "default" or "one-click" payment method on any retail websites.
