# Work Ready

We know you're ready to work and so we want you to be work ready. We'll equip you with a Macbook (or a PC if you're an Engineer) which will arrive at your home address prior to your start date.

In addition to this, you have access to a one off £250 working from home (WFH) allowance. The WFH allowance allows you to purchase items that will assist you in your job role. It can be used from your first day, and doesn’t need to be used in one go. If you are working your notice period, you are unable to use the budget. 

To utilise your WFH allowance; simply order the equipment you require then claim it back via expenses on Xero. You must have an invoice or receipt to ensure you can claim it back on Xero. Once on Xero please log the expense under ‘computer equipment <£250’.

Once a claim is made you will be added to the next available weekly payment run. For any further questions on expenses please read the [expenses process](../guides/compensation/expenses.md).

Examples of things you can order:

- Monitor
- Adapters (HDMI, USBC, etc.)
- Keyboards
- Mice
- Ergonomic chairs, stools, stands
- Standing desks
- Headphones
- Laptop stand
- Docking station 
- Extension lead
- Laptop sleeve

If you are unable to claim items back yourself, please contact the operations team on either [operations@madetech.com](operations@madetech.com) or #ops
