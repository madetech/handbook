# Work Ready

We know you're ready to work and so we want you to be work ready. We'll equip you with a brand new Macbook, monitor, keyboard, adapters, and whatever other technical equipment you need to do your job. 
If you want a book, some software or you just want to go to a conference, it is on us, everyone has a Â£250 working from home budget, just speak to a member of the Operations team, or message in the ops-it-support slack channel.

Here's some examples of things people have purchased:

- New monitor
- Home office equipment
- Adapters (HDMI, USBC, etc.)
- Keyboards
- Mice
- Ergonomic chairs, stools, stands
- Standing desks

## Expenses

Expenses that you've paid for personally, should be put into Xero using the [expenses process](../guides/compensation/expenses.md).
