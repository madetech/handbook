# Remote Working

We feel it's important that we provide the flexibility for people to work wherever they feel productive and happy. Be that in the office, remotely at home, or from a coffee shop. We encourage working remotely, both on an adhoc basis and on a more recurring basis if it suits your current life circumstances.

As a highly collaborative agile team we recognise there are tradeoffs when choosing between working from the office and from home. Below we've highlighted some general ettiquette along with guidelines for working remotely on a regular basis.

If you have any questions or want to challenge the guidelines below in any way, you're always welcome to bring it up with the wider company or with a director.

## General ettiquette

- Check and clear it with the rest of your team before the end of the previous working day
- Once agreed with your team and customers add an event in the remote working calendar
- Check that you're not needed on-site by a customer
- Ensure you're available for a daily standup with your team
- Be a good slack citizen and check in with your team throughout your working day if possible
- Ensure you're completely clear on your specific workload, down to the task level, for the day or days you wish to work from home, and ensure that you're certain you won't benefit from working closely with others on this
- Ensure you're not scheduled for any meetings or other sessions
- Barring any extraordinary circumstances, we like people to be in the office on Friday for [lunch (and hopefully drinks)](/benefits/friday_lunch_drinks.md)

## Regularly working from home

There are additional considerations when regularly working remotely.

- Talk to your team and customers ahead of committing yourself to working remotely on a regular basis
- Once agreed with your team and customers, put a recurring event in the remote working calendar
- We recommend remote working on a recurring basis a maximum of 2 days per week when part of a delivery team – it's important to ensure you get enough face time with your team and customers for asking questions, raising blockers, and showcasing work
- Make sure you choose days that will have the least impact on customers – when working with larger organisations their stakeholders time will be less flexible and thus you'll need to ensure there are clearly set expectations around when showcases will be, etc.
- Again, barring any extraordinary circumstances, we like people to be in the office on Friday
