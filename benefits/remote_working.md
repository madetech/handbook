# Remote Working

We feel it's important that we provide the flexibility for people to work wherever they feel productive and happy. Be that in the office, remotely at home, from a coffee shop, or outside of the UK. We acknowledge that working remotely can lead to increased productivity, and have positive effects on wellbeing. 

### Made Tech offices
Our current requirements for working from Made Tech offices are no longer fixed to a specific number of days per week. This means we now default to remote working with the option to work from your regional Made Tech office as and when needed. 
However, you must be able to travel to your assigned regional office when required to do so. We currently expect this to be on average 1 day per month.

### Client office
Each of our clients will have their own requirements for Made Tech team members to work from their offices. All client facing team members will be required to be able to travel to their assigned client office. We currently expect the needs to be varied, from ‘no office time required’ to ‘2-3 days per week’. Typically, this should be less than 2 days per week though. 

We’ll try to make the requirements for travel as clear as possible as part of the scheduling process. 

### Working abroad
Where possible we will support short-term/ad hoc remote working from outside of the UK (for example if someone wanted to travel and work from abroad for a few weeks during the year and this was viable).
Whilst we will always try to support this, in some cases this may not be feasible. 

When considering this option, you will need to: 
- Discuss with your team (as in some cases, client requirements may not support this)
- Inform your line manager
- Let the People team know
- Ensure you're familiar with our security requirements 

If you remain uncertain or you have any additional questions, please reach out to the Compliance team, Ops, or People. 

### Travel expenses
Team members may expense travel to client sites that are outside of their regional office. Travel within your regional office area is not expensable. 

#### What is part of my regional office?
- London - within the M25
- Manchester - all Manchester postcodes (M postcodes)
- Bristol - within a 25KM radius of Bristol city centre 
- Swansea - within a 25KM radius of Swansea city centre


### Remote Working guidance
- Check that you're not needed on-site by a client or your team
- Ensure you're available for your team ceremonies as normal, and are able to dial in without interruption
- Be a good Slack citizen and check in regularly and visibly with your team throughout the working day in public channels
- Ensure you're not scheduled for any in-person meetings or sessions


### Refusing a Request for Remote Working

For the days that Made Tech or the client requires you to be onsite only:
All requests to work from home should be considered in their individual circumstances. The decision ultimately resides with teams, but below are some guidelines around when you may want to refuse a request to work from home

- If the request will clash with and important ceremony with the client or the rest of the team (planning, retros, etc.)
- If there are concerns the remote working will impact upon the productivity or success of the rest of the team
- If there are concerns about productivity from a team member (this should be first addressed with the team member directly, and with their Line Manager if necessary

### Secure Remote Working

When remote working, and when onsite with a client, it is important to pay close attention to these security guidelines in addition to your normal security practices:

- If you are in a public place, such as a coffee shop, make sure you are handling any sensitive data responsibly and securely. Can you be overseen? Is your connection secure?
 - Ensure any work-related conversations can’t be overheard. If that’s not possible, try to talk in general terms, and without specific details such as names or clients
