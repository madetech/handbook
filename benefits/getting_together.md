# Getting together as a team and company

## Our monthly meet ups
Our Social Committee is made up of reps for each region, who are in charge of organising monthly regional socials. These socials will be low-key, often office based activities (don‚Äôt worry, drinks & snacks/dinner will be provided!)The intention is to facilitate more frequent gatherings, allowing us to stay connected on a regular basis üçïüçú

If you have any suggestions DM one of the reps for your region, and if you would like to get involved reach out to the People Team!

## Our Winter & Summer parties
Every year we hold a larger winter and summer event to celebrate our achievements over the last 6 months and to get together to socialise, network and mingle with our peers and wider team.

_As drinking is exclusionary in nature to those who don't like or can't be around alcohol we make efforts to make sure it's not the centre of our culture whilst at the same time acknowledging it's important to some._
