# Cycle To Work Scheme

We take part in Cyclescheme as we wish to support those who wish to cycle to work whether it's for pleasure, aiming to be healthier, trying to be more green or any other reasons.

Cyclescheme allows you to get up to £1,000 worth of bike and accessories. You then pay a monthly ‘salary sacrifice’ to effectively 'hire' the bike and kit, over a 12 month period. Once this period has been completed you will be given options by Cyclescheme around owning your bike.

You can calculate savings from Cyclescheme using their [calculator](https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/calculator)

## Process for getting a bike through Cyclescheme

    - Lights (front and rear)
    - Helmet
    - Lock
    - Mudguard
- Get a quote/work out the price from the retailer for all of this
- Visit http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/eb76a9
- Fill out the request form
  - You'll need your payroll number which can be found under "Employee ID" on your Xero payslips
- Once your certificate has been requested let a director know so they can find the email and approve it
- Cyclescheme.co.uk will then generate and send an invoice to one of the directors (this will take some time, potentially a few days)
- Once the invoice has been paid, download your certificate/provide it to the chosen retailer
- Ride your new bike!
