# Flexible Working

For a variety of reasons, people may choose to work fewer days per week than the usual Monday - Friday.

Wherever possible we aim to accommodate this.

## Some things to consider

- Please provide as much notice as you're able - ideally 2 months or more - for a change to your working patterns. It allows us to ensure deliveries are resourced appropriately.

- As staffing needs across the business change, we'll do our best to continue to accommodate any flexible working patterns. However, there may be times where we need to discuss temporary or permanent changes to your flexible working schedule. We'll try to give you as much notice as possible of any proposed change.

- Your salary and any bonus payments will be pro-rated as a percentage of a 5 day week. For example, if you opt to work 4 out of 5 days, your salary and any bonus would be reduced by 20%.

- As your salary is reduced, so too will your individual and employer pension contributions. You may consider increasing your individual contribution to account for this.

- As per our [remote working policy](remote_working.md), we encourage Fridays to be spent in the office wherever possible.
