# Flexible Working

Generally, we work Monday to Friday in all roles. But for a variety of reasons, people may need to work fewer than 5 days per week.
We try to accommodate for this when we can. But because of client considerations, and to manage any other business impact, we have a process for requesting a flexible working pattern. 

## Some things to consider

**Notice** - Please provide as much notice as you can - ideally 2 months or more - for a request to change your working patterns. It helps us make sure our client commitments can continue to be met.

**Project and scheduling needs** - As project and scheduling needs change, we'll do our best to accommodate flexible working patterns. But there may be very occasional times when we need to discuss temporary or permanent changes to a flexible working schedule. We'll try to give you as much notice as we can of any possible change.

**Getting paid** - Your salary and any bonus payments will be pro-rated as a percentage of a 5 day week. For example, if you work 4 out of 5 days, your salary and any bonus would be reduced by 20%.

**Pension** - As your salary is reduced, so too will your individual and employer pension contributions. You may like to increase your individual contribution to account for this.

**Trial period** - If you request a flexible working pattern, thereâ€™s usually a trial period to assess the feasibility before any final change is confirmed.

**Reduced working hours** - We can only support reduced working hours and not compressed hours or other patterns (such as annualised hours etc).
