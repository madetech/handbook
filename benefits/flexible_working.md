# Flexible Working

Generally, we work Monday to Friday (40 hours) in all roles. We trust you to manage your day, ensuring team and client commitments are met.  But for a variety of reasons, people may need to work fewer than 5 days per week.
A formal flexible working request is where you request to contractually change your working arrangements on a permanent basis. This could be a request to change your working hours, which days you work or the location you work from and we have an internal process to support this.

## Some things to consider

**Notice** - Please provide as much notice as you can - ideally 2 months or more - for a request to change your working patterns. It helps us make sure our client commitments can continue to be met.

**Project and scheduling needs** - As project and scheduling needs change, we'll do our best to accommodate flexible working patterns. But there may be very occasional times when we need to discuss temporary or permanent changes to a flexible working schedule. We'll try to give you as much notice as we can of any possible change.

**Getting paid** - Your salary and any bonus payments will be pro-rated as a percentage of a 5 day week. For example, if you work 4 out of 5 days, your salary and any bonus would be reduced by 20%.

**Pension** - As your salary is reduced, so too will your individual and employer pension contributions. You may like to increase your individual contribution to account for this.

**Trial period** - If you request a flexible working pattern, thereâ€™s usually a trial period to assess the feasibility before any final change is confirmed.

**Reduced working hours** - We can only support reduced working hours and not compressed hours or other patterns (such as annualised hours etc).
