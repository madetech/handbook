# Flexible benefits allowance

From 17th May, if you have passed your probation you will be able to access your flexible benefits allowance via Made Tech Benefits Box.

### What is a flexible benefits allowance?
A flexible benefits allowance is an additional pot of money allocated to you to distribute across a range of benefits.

### How much do I get?
Every permanent member of staff will receive 3.66% of their annual salary as a benefits allowance which they can access via Made Tech Benefits Box. As you recieve salary increases and or promotions your benefits allowance will reflect 3.66% of the new salary. Salaries will be refreshed on a monthly basis to reflect salary changes.

### Why 3.66%
At the beginning of this journey when asked which benefits were most important, pensions came up a lot. After many calculations this number was chosen to allow employees to increase their pensions contributions and potentially have some left over to spend elsewhere.

### I’m in my probation period, can I access this now?
This benefit becomes active after passing probation.

### What benefits can I distribute my allowance across?
Currently you can opt into a health care cash plan or increase your pension contribution. We are looking into what additional options there are. Our key reason for launching Made Tech benefits box is to ensure we can keep adding benefits that are valuable for you. 

### Where can I see my allowance amount?
You can see your benefits allowance amount in Made Tech Benefits Box (madetechbenefitsbox.com). This platform will allow you to choose which benefits to distribute your allowance across.
