 # Pension Scheme

We have introduced a much-improved pension offering for all employees (as of May 2022). The pension scheme is run by Scottish Widows and follows a contribution matching model where Made Tech matches the level of contribution you decide to make. 

The pension contribution available to you is tied to your SFIA level, with pensions for SFIA 2-4 being up to 12% (6% matched), pensions for SFIA 5 being up to 14% (7% matched), pensions for SFIA 6 being up to 16% (8% matched) and pensions for SFIA 7 being up to 18% (9% matched). 

Our pension scheme is based on a salary sacrifice approach which is more tax-efficient for both employer and employee. We have removed the qualifying earnings limit, which should simplify pension management for those of you who are higher rate taxpayers. If you want to calculate your contributions you can use the calculator on the [Scottish Widows](https://www.scottishwidows.co.uk/retirement/calculators-tools/how-do-you-pay-to-your-pension/salary-sacrifice/) website.


- In order to allocate your preferred contribution, or opt out, we have circulated a form internally for this. You will be able to adjust this annually, or in the case if significant life events
- There are also [Government guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/if-you-want-to-leave-your-workplace-pension-scheme) on doing so here
