 # Pension Scheme

We provide a pension scheme inline with the UK Government's rollout of automatic enrolment. We automatically enrol everyone in our pension scheme after their probation period (usually 3 months).

- If you want to opt out there are now [Government guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/if-you-want-to-leave-your-workplace-pension-scheme) on doing so

## Pension contributions

As your employer we will contribute towards your pension alongside your own contribution. 

From April 2019 the minimum amount that you pay into your pension is **5%** and we pay **3%** — a total minimum contribution equivalent to **8%** overall. Contributions are capped on qualifying earnings in line with [The Pension Regulator thresholds](https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/business-advisers/automatic-enrolment-guide-for-business-advisers/9-knowing-your-clients-ongoing-duties/automatic-enrolment-earnings-threshold). Any earnings outside of these thresholds (Earnings between Lower Level and Upper Level) will not attract pension contributions. 

Each employee in addition to their salary receives a flexible benefits allowance of 3.66% of their annual salary of which can be distributed across benefits including increased pension contributions.

You can choose to increase your pension contribution sooner. You can do this by speaking with our finance department on finance@madetech.com.

## How contributions are calculated

The workplace pension plan we use is a **relief at source** scheme. This means that pension contributions are taken _after_ tax has been deducted from your salary. 

As private pension contributions are tax-exempt, the income tax that has been paid on your contributions is claimed back when the money reaches your pension plan. When you choose to pay a certain amount of your monthly salary into the pension plan, 80% of that amount will be deducted from your net pay and the remaining 20% (representing the [basic rate of income tax](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates)) will be claimed back by Royal London as tax relief.

### Higher rate tax payer

If you are a higher rate tax payer you pay 40% income tax on any earnings above £50,000, leaving you entitled to an additional tax relief beyond the 20% recovered automatically. You must claim this additional tax relief to ensure that your pension contributions are entirely tax-free.

In order to do that, you will need to [complete a self assessment](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/pension-tax-relief#when-you-have-to-claim-tax-relief) form at the end of each tax year and will be entitled to a tax rebate that can be paid directly to your bank account.

It's important to be aware that any additional tax rebate will be paid back to you directly and not into your pension plan. Therefore, you may wish to increase your pension contributions in order to achieve the desired percentage contribution from your gross salary.

## Topping up your pension

On May 17th 2021 Made Tech rolled out an individual flexible benefits allowance which employees can distribute across a range of benefits including pensions and a health care cash plan. To top up your pension with your benefits allowance please follow these steps.

1. Go to madetechbenefitsbox.com
2. Log in
3. Select Pension on the homepage
4. Here you will find options which will allow you to choose a pension contribution amount which will be transfered from your benefits allowance.

## Upcoming changes to pensions 

We have completed the review of our pension offering and will be introducing a much-improved pension offering for all employees from April 2022. The new pension scheme will be run by Scottish Widows and will follow a contribution matching model where Made Tech matches the level of contribution you decide to make. 

The pension available to you will be tied to your SFIA level, with pensions for SFIA 2-4 being up to 12% (6% matched), pensions for SFIA 5 being up to 14% (7% matched), pensions for SFIA 6 being up to 16% (8% matched) and pensions for SFIA 7 being up to 18% (9% matched). 

The new pension scheme will be based on a salary sacrifice approach which is more tax-efficient for both employer and employee. We’ll be removing the qualifying earnings limit, which should significantly simplify pension management for those of you who are higher rate taxpayers. If you want to calculate your contributions you can use the calculator on the [Scottish Widows](https://www.scottishwidows.co.uk/retirement/calculators-tools/how-do-you-pay-to-your-pension/salary-sacrifice/) website.

We’ll kick off the work to transition to the new scheme in the coming weeks, more information to follow soon.
