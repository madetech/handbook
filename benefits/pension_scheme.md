# Pension Scheme

We have introduced a much-improved pension offering for all employees (as of May 2022). The workplace pension scheme is run by Scottish Widows and follows a contribution matching model where Made Tech matches the level of contribution you decide to make.

The pension contribution available to you is aligned to your SFIA level, with pensions for SFIA 2-4 being up to 12% (6% matched), pensions for SFIA 5 being up to 14% (7% matched), pensions for SFIA 6 being up to 16% (8% matched) and pensions for SFIA 7 being up to 18% (9% matched).

Our pension scheme is based on a salary sacrifice approach which is more tax-efficient for both employer and employee. We have removed the qualifying earnings limit, which should simplify pension management for those of you who are higher rate taxpayers. If you want to calculate your contributions you can use the calculator on the [Scottish Widows](https://www.scottishwidows.co.uk/retirement/calculators-tools/how-do-you-pay-to-your-pension/salary-sacrifice/) website.

- In order to allocate your preferred contribution, or opt out, there is a form shared during onboarding for new starters to complete. You can opt out at any point by emailing finance@madetech.com, copying in people@madetech.com.

- You will be able to adjust your contribution level in a set window in spring (open to all) annually, or at any point in the case of significant life events where this may result in a change in financial circumstances. If you are affected by the latter please email finance@madetech.com and copy in people@madetech.com
