# Lunchers

Every fortnight we select three groups of five people to have a team lunch and join any new starters in a de-regionalised format, with the day it’s held on rotation each time.

This ritual provides an inclusive opportunity for the team to socialise and share their successes and challenges. 
It's important that we continue to set aside the time for this, especially when as many of us work remotely most of the time.

## How it works

The People & Culture Advisors will organise three lunchers groups every fortnight. *You can only expense your lunch if invited to do so by them.*

While we're working remotely, order from your favourite restaurant, or purchase ingredients from a supermarket (up to a maximum of £20) and expense back under the "Staff Meals" section on Xero.

If you have any questions, ask the People or Finance Team.
