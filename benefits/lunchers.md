# Lunchers 

Once a month in each office we select 5 people to have lunch together on us! Order from your favourite restaurant, nip to the shops, find a local cafe or head for a walk around Borough Market - the choice is yours!

## How it works

- At the start of the month the date for each region will be posted in the Slack channel. To be in with a chance of being selected, book your desk and make sure you are in the office on that day!
- The day before lunch the lucky lunchers will be posted in the regions Slack channel - if you cant make it, give your spot to someone else whos in.

*You can only expense your lunch if you are chosen for lunchers.*

If you have any questions, ask the People or Finance Team.
