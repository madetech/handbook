# Retrospectives

These retrospectives occur every 2 weeks on a Friday. There are 2 hours booked for this purpose. 

There are two elements to retrospectives:

* Retrospective (smaller groups performing retrospectives)
* Comradrospective (whole company retrospective format)

## Purpose 

The purpose of retrospectives is to:

* Examine outcomes from previous retrospective, and understand what went well, and what didn’t.
* Create action points or decide on problems that the team will tackle
* Provide a conduit to allow continuous improvement to be facilitated safely within teams.


The purpose of the comradrospective is to:

*  Examine previous action points, what went well and what didn’t.
*  Avoid “localised optimisations” i.e. the action points of one smaller group, hurting the whole.
*  Set one or two action points, or problems, for the whole company to focus on.

### Action points

Remember that action points are only potential solutions to a problem. In order to aid examining your own achievements, being able to measure the impact of your action points by some form of measurable yard-stick can be quite helpful. Establishing a definition of awesome is one accepted solution to this, or some sort of hard metric can also help.

### Tackling problems

Sometimes it is not immediately obvious how to solve a problem that the team is collectively facing. In these situations it may be wise to have the team attempt to resolve a particularly pressing pain point during normal working time.

Similar to action points, it’s important that the team is able to measure and sense check whether it has made progress towards some goal. 

Make sure the team has awareness on what the outcome of potential solutions would look like.

## Format

Teams are expected to self-organise into groups that make sense to perform retrospectives with.

Team members should only attend one retrospective, and then the comradrospective.

## Timing

* The first hour is booked for smaller group retrospectives
* The second hour is booked for the comradrospective

## Expectations

Teams are expected to self-manage which includes time boxing their retrospectives.

If you wish to perform your retrospective at a different time, or, more or less frequently. You are free to do so, so long as you have sought both agreement and input from your group.

Any improvements, changes to the comradrospective, should be discussed at the comradrospective with everyone it will affect involved.

### Facilitators

Teams are expected to elect a facilitator for their individual retrospectives.

The facilitation role should be seen as a skill that can be improved, and facilitators should treat it as such.

**[Unsolved Problem]** There is value in the facilitator of the comradrospective not becoming a static role. The company needs a way to self-manage who takes this role, either changing every two-weekly or changing every 2,3,4 retrospectives??

## Notes

The format is expected to be evolutionary, this document serves as it's living documentation.
