# Retrospectives

These retrospectives occur every 2 weeks on a Friday. There is 2 hours booked for this purpose. 

There are main elements to retrospectives:

* Retrospective (smaller groups performing retrospectives)
* Comradrospective (whole company retrospective format)

The purpose of retrospectives is to:

* Provide a conduit to allow continuous improvement to be facilitated safely within teams.
* Examine outcomes from previous retrospective, and understand what went well, and what didn’t.

The purpose of the comradrospective is to:

*  Examine previous action points, and what went well and what didn’t.
*  Avoid “localised optimisations” i.e. the action points of one smaller group, hurting the whole.
*  Set one or two action points, or problems, for the whole company to focus on.

## Format

Teams are expected to self-organise into groups that make sense to perform retrospectives with.

Team members should only attend one retrospective, and then the comradrospective.

## Timing

* The first hour is booked for smaller group retrospectives
* The second hour is booked for the comradrospective

## Facilitators

Teams are expected to self-manage and elect a facilitator for their individual retrospectives.

The facilitation role should be seen as a skill that can be improved, and facilitators should treat it as such.

**[Unsolved Problem]** There is value in the facilitator of the comradrospective not becoming a static role. The company needs a way to self-manage who takes this role, either changing every two-weekly or changing every 2,3,4 retrospectives??

## Expectations

Teams are expected to self-manage which includes time boxing their retrospectives.

If you wish to perform your retrospective at a different time, or, more or less frequently. You are free to do so, so long as you have sought both agreement and input from your group.

Any improvements, changes to the comradrospective, should be discussed at the comradrospective with everyone it will affect involved.

## Notes

The format is expected to evolutionary, this document serves as living documentation.
