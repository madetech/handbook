# Delivery Healthcheck

We ask teams to provide Delivery Healthchecks to the wider business to encourage the implementation of our Delivery Standards.

It is the responsibility of the lead on each delivery team to provide an update on the health of their delivery in each week's BizOps showcase.

A Delivery Healthcheck should answer:

## Current iteration
 - When was your current iteration started?
 - What is your current iteration goal?
 - When is your next showcase?
 - Are you on track to meet customer expectations?

## Next iteration
 - What is the goal for your next iteration?

## Retrospective
 - When was your last retrospective?
 - What were your last retrospective action points?
