# Delivery Healthcheck

We ask teams to provide Delivery Healthchecks to the wider business to encourage the implementation of our Delivery Standards.

It is the responsibility of the lead on each delivery team to provide an update on the health of their delivery in each week's TGIF.

A Delivery Healthcheck should answer:

## Where you're working in defined iterations

### Current iteration
 - When was your current iteration started?
 - What is your current iteration goal?

### Next iteration
 - What is the goal for your next iteration?

## Where you're working in a kanban flow

 - What business objective are you working towards?
 - What is your current work in progress?
 - What are you currently blocked on?
 - What did your team achieve during the past week?

## Always

 - When is your next showcase?
 - Are you on track to meet customer expectations?

### Retrospective
 - When was your last retrospective?
 - What were your last retrospective action points?
