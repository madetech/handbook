# Delivery Healthcheck

It is the responsibility of the lead on each delivery team to provide an update on the health of their delivery in each week's BizOps showcase.

A Delivery Healthcheck should answer:

## Current iteration goal
 - When was your current iteration started?
 - When is your next showcase?
 - Are you on track to meet customer expectations?

## Next iteration goal
 - What is the goal for your next iteration?

## Retrospective
 - When was your last retrospective?
 - What were your last retrospective action points?
