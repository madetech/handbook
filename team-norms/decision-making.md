# Decision Making

Any person can make any decision after seeking advice from:

1) everyone who will be meaningfully affected, and 
2) people with expertise in the matter. 

Advice received must be taken into consideration.

## Further clarification

This self-management approach does not require consensus, just that advice is taken into consideration.
After seeking advice, the advice seeker can still choose to make the decision anyway.

While consensus may appear appealing on the surface, if everybody has a power of veto this may result in a plea for someone to make any decision. 

In the advice process, no one has power over anybody else. Ergo, there is not the power to block progress.

Ownership stays clearly with one person: the decision maker. Convinced she made the best possible decision, she can see things through with enthusiasm. 

The advice process, then, transcends both top-down and consensus-based decision making

## Conflict resolution

We believe that workers are thoughtful, trustworthy adults, capable of being accountable and responsible for their decisions and actions.

It’s impossible to change other people. We can only change ourselves.

* We take ownership for our thoughts, beliefs, words, and actions.
* We don’t spread rumors.
* We don’t talk behind someone’s back.
* We resolve disagreements one-on-one and don’t drag other people into the problem.
* We don’t blame problems on others. When we feel like blaming, we take it as an invitation to reflect on how we might be part of the problem (and the solution).
* We focus on strengths more than weaknesses, on opportunities more than problems.

**Unsolved problem** - We need to adopt a team norm that deals with conflict within Made Tech that transcends a traditional "go to your boss" method of resolution.
