# Continuous Feedback

The techniques we use to deliver software tell us to value things like regular, open communication and fast feedback loops. We’re aiming to cultivate a culture where individual performance can be evaluated and coached equally regularly.

There is a growing trend for organisations to throw away the annual / bi-annual review, and move to more informal and more frequent check-ins. Adobe is one such business, and they’ve published much of their collateral online, on which this structure is based.

In contrast to how feedback is delivered at present, which is a largely ‘top-down’ approach, we would like to shift to a model where each team member is ultimately responsible for pro-actively soliciting feedback on their own performance.

## How does it work?

Our continuous feedback sessions involve 2 people, yourself and a facilitator. The aim of a continuous feedback session is to:

 - Receive and acknowledge feedback
 - Setting and reviewing longer term goals
 - Setting and reviewing short term goals

The facilitator will always be a colleague and will frequently be a director. Their role is to help you make sense of your feedback and to help you track your progress against goals you've set yourself.

### Receive and acknowledge feedback

When your colleagues have feedback for you they will leave it on a Trello card on our [Continuous Feedback](https://trello.com/b/yM4p07sz/continuous-feedback) board.

You'll notice there is a column for Upcoming and Done. When you create your card make sure you put your face and your facilitators face on the it. Also put a deadline time so everyone is aware.

If you forget to add your latest card for your next session don't worry, your colleagues will happily create one for you when they have some feedback for you. This is actually a nice way to remind people to have their session.

When you provide feedback to someone you should create a checklist on their card with the title being your name and each bullet being a piece of feedback.

In your session you will go through each of your feedback one by one discussing with your facilitator and checking them off as you go. If you feel like you need to record the feedback more permanently you can do this in your CF spreadsheet's first tab.

You won't always want to record your feedback, it might just be a nice pat on the back that you can recognise and move on. Something like "thanks for making that great cup of tea" won't always need to be recorded. That said, if it makes you feel better recording it, knock yourself out.

### Setting and reviewing longer term goals

Once you've recorded your feedback it's worth recaping over your Growth & Development Objectives.

These are medium to long term goals. If you are working towards a [Trait](/roles/engineer.md#engineer-traits) you will likely have it listed here. It's worth noting we also highlight our larger goal on the Trello board's people column.

We typically only highlight one goal here so people know your focus and are encouraged to provide feedback for it.

### Setting and reviewing short term goals

After reviewing your feedback and your longer term goals you will then typically have a look at your short term goals, cross out anyones you've recently achieved and then come up with one or two for you to tackle by your next session.

At the end of your session don't forget to thank your facilitator :)

## How often should I have a session?

Seeing as Continuous Feedback sessions are self organised it is mostly up to you to make sure they happen. We do have a few tricks up our sleeves to encourage them though.

We set up two recurring events in your calendar. One for your peer CF session and one for your director CF session. They'll be spaced out two weeks apart, for example if you had your peer CF session on the first Monday of the month, your director CF session would be on the third Monday of the month.

You should make sure in advance, at least a few days, that you have a facilitator booked in. Asking people last minute can sometimes result in disappointment when they can't make it.

So the answer is that you should have at least one session every two weeks. You can of course organise more than that if you want one sooner.

## What kind of feedback should I give?

The SAID model provides a simple way to give effective, positive, and constructive feedback:

 - **Specifics:** state what has or has not been done using concrete examples
 - **Ask:** ask open ended questions to understand their perspective (How do you see the situation? Did I contribute to the problem in some way?)
 - **Impact:** express the impact on the team or the business. When framed as a means to reach a specific business objective, it should become an opportunity to solve a problem or understand the impact of the actions
 - **Do:** state what needs to continue or change
 
Feedback should be given with the following principles in mind:

 - Given with positive intent to help to be more effective in future
 - Close to the event
 - Don’t give feedback when angry or upset
 - Leverage the SAID model
 - Two questions to give effective feedback:
    - What does this person do well that makes them effective? Be specific and share with them why it’s impactful
    - What is one thing, looking forward, they could change or do more of that would make them more effective?

If you have feedback concerning more than one person, submit it to both people. Depending on the issue/feedback, calling a having a separate meeting/discussion outside of CF might be a better solution such as a retrospective or comradrospective.

## How should I receive feedback?

 - Listen carefully
 - Ask questions - seek to understand the impact
 - Ask for specific examples if you are not clear
 - Remember that we all have areas for development
 - Don’t become defensive (feedback is hard to give, and we want to encourage everyone to be giving more feedback)
 - Say “thank you”
 - If you choose to implement the feedback, check back in future to validate improvement
 - Try and make sure you read feedback ahead of your session so you can clarify any uncertainties ahead of your CF session
 - If you disagree with feedback, have a discussion with your facilitator about why you disagree
 - If you have any feedback that you do not think is helpful or constructive, bring this up with your facilitator and don't hesitate to raise it with a director or another colleague if you feel it necessary

## What should I consider during my CF session?

Some sample questions you and your facilitator can discuss to have a great session:

* Over the next period of time (sprint, week, month), what are the critical priorities that we must accomplish? How do they align with team / organisation goals?
* What is the overall desired outcome? What will success look like? How will we measure it?
* What is important context (constraints, history, third parties) that would be useful to know in order to achieve the desired outcome?
* When and how shall we check-in to review progress?
* How can the facilitator support you in achieving the expectations?

There can sometimes be sessions with very little, or no feedback received. It's still a good opportunity to review short term and long term goals. The following session might have an influx of feedback, so it's important to keep holding these sessions every two weeks, as we don't want feedback to go stale
If you have feedback concerning more than one person, submit it to both people.

Depending on the issue/feedback, calling a having a separate meeting/discussion outside of CF might be a better solution.

When driving discussions and planning your development, here are some things to consider:

* What skills and strengths do I have that I want to continue to leverage or build on?
* What skills and knowledge do I need to develop to perform well in my role?
* What are business needs I see that can provide an opportunity to help me grow in these areas?
* What are my long term aspirations?
* What support do I need from others to be more successful?
* How will I measure my success?
