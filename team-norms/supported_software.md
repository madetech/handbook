# Supported Software

Where the day-to-day running of an application needs to transition to our support team, there are specific considerations you must take when making technology choices.

As an organisation we're keen to embrace new and diverse technology where there's a strong commercial justification.

When you're considering a major technology choice that isn't documented here, before starting a production implementation you must seek agreement from the support team that they're able to provide BAU support.

The decision to self-host a third party application must involve the support team. You can expect to be encouraged to seek SaaS alternatives.

Where the application is transitioning to a customer support team for ongoing support and maintenance, you're strongly advised to consult with the customer team on any major technology decisions.
