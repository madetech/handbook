# Principles (DRAFT)

**_How we deliver in teams and work with clients_**

## Create impact for all
We create services that balance needs, policy goals and what's possible now. Public services exist to create an impact on people's lives. Good services deliver positive outcomes for society that are fair and equitable for all. Be that cleaner air, safer roads, more jobs or better use of taxes. We understand that all that we do has an impact, no matter how large or small. 

## Build successful teams
Success comes from our culture of a people-first approach. To build the right team we focus on inclusivity, making sure we’re truly representative of the communities we serve. We bring people together with a mixture of seniority and experience of skill sets, and give everyone the opportunity to explore. We trust one another, assume best intentions, respect hands-on skills and always make time for building relationships.

## Everyone can learn
We’re passionate about the value of learning, always striving to leave our clients, partners and suppliers with the skills, enthusiasm and credibility to keep delivering. Learning works both ways – we understand that others can teach us as much as we can guide them. 

## Make real solutions
We measure value in our work by delivering _real_ things that impact our clients, citizens and society. Inviting feedback and seeking the shortest path to genuine value is how we see the change our work creates in people’s lives. 

## Do less to achieve more
Big ideas are central to fundamental change. We keep our approaches simple so we can solve the complicated challenges that come with these big ideas. By working in agile teams, designing fewer features and writing in simple terms everyone understands, we create strong foundations to build on.

## Deliver little and often
By delivering features step by step we can get the small stuff out first, giving real value to the people who need it, quickly. Through inviting feedback early and often, we learn, iterate and reduce risk.

## Build trust, accountability and authenticity
Openness is built into the core of everything we do. We use open techniques on our projects, in our business and with one another. Sharing our successes and failures makes our relationships stronger, builds trust, gives us room to grow and holds us accountable. Working in this way allows others to reuse and feedback on our work as we continue to learn. 

## Be brave, be curious
We have the courage to challenge the status quo and the curiosity to innovate. By exploring new ways of doing things and taking lessons learnt, we can build services the public sector needs. We recognise there's always a different way of solving a challenge, often supported by proven practices and technologies.

## Believe in compromise
There's no such thing as perfect and we acknowledge that tradeoffs can often be part of our work. Throughout challenging decisions, we always focus on quality within our limits, recognising when to shift deadlines and make smart business decisions, always with a humble approach.

## Build lasting relationships
As trusted advisors we always aim to go above and beyond. We collaborate with our clients, truly bringing them into designing the future of their services. Working together we support them to define and solve their challenges, building long term partnerships. 

## Work ourselves out of a job
Sustainable change is about helping our clients deliver services effectively and independently. Successful collaboration helps us nurture long term partnerships so we can return and support the next challenge. 

## Leave things better than we found them
Our work involves trying to meet the often competing needs of our people, clients and users while building practical solutions. This means knowing sometimes we must build trust now to return later to focus on creating a bigger impact.
