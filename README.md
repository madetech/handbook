# Made Tech Handbook

At Made Tech, we're building an open and transparent company, full of people who love their work and enjoy the challenges they face every day. To do this, we want everyone to understand what is expected of them, the things we value and the things we believe should be avoided.

This handbook should be the starting point for any new team members. It provides an overview of the business and a point of reference for topics such as expense policy, referral bonuses and remote working policies.

## Improving software delivery in every organisation

We've seen many organisations constrained by poor choices when it comes to software. Whether it's keeping a slow legacy system around, or neglecting a team that needs help, these decisions impede an organisation's ability to compete in a competitive world.

We believe there's a better way, one that encourages an open and collaborative relationship with everyone involved, and one that places importance on the ability to deliver great software quickly.

## Our values

* **People:** We value and respect the people we work with, both within the company and without, and want them to feel able to express their opinions safely and without fear.

* **Space:** We value the space in which we work, and want it to be a place in which everyone can pursue and share knowledge whilst feeling respected, comfortable and productive.

* **Culture:** We value a positive and diverse company culture, and will always strive to adapt our culture in order to make this a more welcoming place to be.

## Contributing to our handbook

We're a company that moves fast, so we're going to need everyone to help us keep this up to date. If you encounter something that you think should be in this Handbook, add it to the document. If you see something that doesn't represent our current thinking, gather feedback and update.
