# Made Tech Handbook

At Made Tech, we're building an open and transparent company, full of people who love their work and enjoy the challenges they face every day. To do this, we want everyone to understand what is expected of them, the things we value and the things we believe should be avoided.

This handbook should be the starting point for any new team members. It provides an overview of the business and a point of reference for topics such as expense policy, referral bonuses and remote working policies.

## Our values

* **People:** We value and respect the people we work with, both within the company and without, and want them to feel able to express their opinions safely and without fear.

* **Space:** We value the space in which we work, and want it to be a place in which everyone can pursue and share knowledge whilst feeling respected, comfortable and productive.

* **Culture:** We value a positive and diverse company culture, and will always strive to adapt our culture in order to make this a more welcoming place to be.

* **Continuous Improvement:** We value continuous improvement, and seek to empower ourselves and the people around us with the opportunity to reflect and improve.
