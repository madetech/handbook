# Made Tech Handbook

At Made Tech we want to positively impact the future of the country by using technology to improve society. We work with public sector organisations to modernise technology and accelerate digital delivery so that citizens can benefit from better public services.

We're building an open and transparent company across the UK, full of people who are passionate about their work, always strive to be better, love to help others grow, and care about using digital and technology to create a better, fairer society.

This Handbook should be the starting point for any new team members. It provides an overview of [why we exist](company/about.md), our roles, our investment into staff welfare, our team norms, and details of our processes, policies and benefits.
