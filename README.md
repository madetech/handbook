# Made Tech Handbook

At Made Tech, we're tying to build an open and transparent company, full of people who love their work and enjoy the challenges they face every day. To do this, we want everyone to understand what is expected of them, the things we value and the things we try to avoid.

This handbook should be the starting point for any new team members. It provides an overview of the business and a point of reference for topics such as expense policy, referral bonuses and remote working policies.

This document was borne out of our [Continuous Feedback](policies/continuous_feedback.md) process, as team members were unclear on some of the incentives that we offer.

We're a company that moves fast, so we're going to need everyone to help us keep this up to date. If you encounter something that you think should be in this Handbook, add it to the document. If you see something that doesn't represent our current thinking, gather feedback and update.
