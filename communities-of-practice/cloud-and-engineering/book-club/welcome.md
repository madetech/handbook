# Welcome to the Book Club

👋 Welcome to our Cloud and Engineering Book Club! At Made Tech we are passionate about [learning](../../../guides/learning/README.md). In this Book Club, we choose a technical book in the cloud and engineering space and gather once per month to discuss it. We hope to see you there soon!

This page is about what the Book Club is all about. For all things books, take a look at our [library](library.md).

## Purpose

As engineers in delivery teams, we want to continously improve our capabilities and how we deliver working software. By using a technical book to give our minds some direction, we will be able to share our own relevant knowledge and experiences and discuss the book's content - the questions it asks of us - and how it can make us more well-rounded engineers.

## Format?

- It should be a free-flowing session and we'll use the book to provide direction.
- At the end, we'll have a chat about what to read before the next meet-up.
- We meet on the third Friday of the month at 1600.
- It's an open invite to anyone at Made Tech. Just head over to the #eng-book-club Slack channel to pick up the link!

## What do I need to do?

### Before the meeting

- 💰 Use your learning budget to get your copy of the book!
- 📖 Try and read the agreed sections of the book.
- 🧐 While you read, you could try to think about any puzzles that came to mind, any challenges you'd like to pose to the group, or any times you've seen the technique work/fail in real life. 

### During the meeting

- 🗣 Chip in where you're happy to, whether that's a block of text you've underlined, an opinion you wanted to share or a spur of the moment contribution!
- 🧘‍♀️ Or take a back seat if that's what you're comfortable with.
