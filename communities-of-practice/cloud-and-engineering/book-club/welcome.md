# Welcome to the Book Club

👋 Welcome to our Cloud and Engineering Book Club! At Made Tech we are passionate about [learning](../../../guides/learning/README.md). In this Book Club, we choose a technical book in the cloud and engineering space and gather once a fortnight to discuss it. We hope to see you there soon!

This page is about what the Book Club is all about. For all things books, take a look at our [library](./library/library.md).

## Purpose

As engineers in delivery teams, we want to continously improve our capabilities and how we deliver working software. By using a technical book to give our minds some direction, we will be able to share our own relevant knowledge and experiences to discuss and build on the book's content - the questions it asks of us - and how it can make us more well-rounded engineers.

## Format?

- We meet every other Friday at 1530 for 50 minutes.
- Anyone at Made Tech can subscribe to the club's calendar to get the invite. Just head over to the #eng-bookclub Slack channel and pick up the pinned post!
- We'll cover off an overview of the chapter.
- We'll cover off some of our own highlights.
- We'll then vote on some cards and discuss the most popular questions and deep dives that come to mind.
- At the end, we'll decide for next time.

## What do I need to do?

### Before the meeting

- 💰 Use your learning budget to get your copy of the book!
- 📖 Try and read the agreed sections of the book.
- 🧐 While you read, you could try to think about any puzzles that came to mind, any challenges you'd like to pose to the group, any times you've seen the technique work/fail in real life, or just things you find insightful.
- 💡 Add your thoughts to the (internal) Trello board, which is pinned to the #eng-bookclub Slack channel.

### During the meeting

- 🚶‍♀️ We'll walk through the cards chapter-by-chapter
- 🗣 Chip in where you're happy to, whether that's a card you added, an opinion you want to share or a spur of the moment contribution!
- 🧘‍♀️ Or take a back seat if that's what you're comfortable with.
