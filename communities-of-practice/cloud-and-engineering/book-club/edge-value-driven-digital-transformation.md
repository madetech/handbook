Authors: Jim Highsmith, Linda Luu and David Robinson  
Recommended by: Chasey  
_[EDGE](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43567723-edge) embraces an adaptive mindset in the face of market uncertainty, a visible, value-centered portfolio approach that encourages continual value linkages from vision to detailed initiatives, incremental funding that shifts as strategies evolve, collaborative decision-making, and better risk mitigation. This guide shows leaders how to use the breakthrough EDGE approach to go beyond incremental improvement in a world of exponential opportunities._

## 20th May
_Authored by Reuben_. We had our first ever session!! We went over the rough format and covered just managed to cover the introduction and "Chapter 1: The Big Picture". We wondered at whether fast meant good (it doesn't) but expected to talk about that more in later chapters. We also spoke about our [mainly negative] experiences of Agile at scale and the challenges it presents and what it means to us to be agile. Lastly, this chapter talks about the new / digital-age fitness function and we started to ask how we might measure customer value, without externalising what should be internal team metrics. Great stuff! We decided we'd read "Chapter 2: Tech@Core" and "Chapter 3: EDGE Principles" for next time, but might not expect to cover it all as Tech@Core seems an interesting subject!
