## Beliefs & Values

* We believe that everyone in our company should be learning something new every day. We invest heavily into initiatives which will help us to cultivate an environment where **everyone** is striving to perform better.

* We believe that responsibility is taken, not given. We believe people need to to use their own initiative and take opportunities when they present themselves.

* We believe that 'doing' is more valuable than 'talking'. We don't have account managers or talkers amongst our ranks and everyone we hire are do'ers. We have very few talkers in our ranks.

* We believe that nearly all organisations can move faster than they do. We try to help them to do this.

* We believe the adoption of Agile is in it's infancy and that Agile principles (and various spin offs) will underpin all high-performance businesses in years to come.
