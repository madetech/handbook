# First Day

If it's your first day today, we'd just like you to know how happy we are to have you with us :)

To give you an idea of what to expect from your on-boarding, we have written this short guide. It covers the things that we think are important for new starters and we hope it provides a basis for your successful on-boarding.

Over the next few days and weeks we'll introduce:

1. **Company mission, [values](https://github.com/madetech/handbook#our-values), business services and bizops** - We'll talk about our mission and why the business exists. We'll tell you why we think it's important to improve software delivery in every organisation and how you can help us to achieve our mission.
2. **Peer buddy** — As part of our on-boarding process, we'll introduce you to a company buddy who will be available whenever you need them. If anything crops (from simple questions to emergencies), feel free to let your buddy know and they will do all they can to help.

   It goes without saying that myself and the other directors (+ rest of the team) are here too, so there should be plenty of places to turn if you need anything.
3. [**Continuous feedback**](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/master/team-norms/continuous_feedback.md) — Next up we'll take you through our Continuous Feedback process and explain how you can use this to provide / receive feedback from colleagues. We'll organise your first CF session with one of the directors, who will work with you to define long and short term career objectives.
4. [**Role expectations**](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/tree/master/roles/) — All our team members have role expectations and we'll work with you to introduce these to you over the coming weeks.
5. **Director 121s** — As part of your on-boarding process and ongoing career development, you'll have a monthly 121 with one of the company directors. These sessions are an opportunity for us to review your progress, look at areas where we can provide support.
6. **Comradrospective** — On every second Friday, we have a company Comradrospective. The idea behind this is to share learnings from across the company to look at how we can improve. Please contribute to these and once you're feeling confident enough, look to facilitate one of them
7. **Salary, Pensions & Expenses** — We'll take you through how our finance work, where to go to if you have any questions around salary, pensions or if you need to submit an expense claim / get a company credit card.
