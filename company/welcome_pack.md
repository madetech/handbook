# Welcome Pack

If it's your first day today, we'd just like you to know how happy we are to have you with us :)

To give you an idea of what to expect from your on-boarding, we have written this short guide. It covers the things that we think are important for new starters and we hope it provides a basis for your successful on-boarding.

Over the next few days and weeks we'll introduce:

1. **Company mission, [values](about.md#our-values), business services and EOSs** - We'll talk about our mission and why the business exists. We'll tell you why we think it's important to improve software delivery in every organisation and how you can help us to achieve our mission.
2. **Peer buddy** — As part of our on-boarding process, we'll introduce you to a company buddy who will be available whenever you need them. If anything crops up (from simple questions to emergencies), feel free to let your buddy know and they will do all they can to help.

   It goes without saying that the rest of the team are here too, so there should be plenty of places to turn if you need anything.
3. [**Role expectations**](../roles/README.md) — All our team members have role expectations and we'll work with you to introduce these to you over the coming weeks.
4. **Career development 121s** — As part of your on-boarding process and ongoing career development, you'll have a monthly 121 with your Line Manager or one of the company directors. These sessions are an opportunity for us to review your progress, look at areas where we can provide support.
5. **Marketplace** — Every Friday, we run showcases. Please contribute to these and once you're feeling confident enough, look to facilitate one of them.
6. **Salary, Pensions & Expenses** — We'll take you through how our finances work, where to go to if you have any questions around salary, pensions, benefits or if you need to submit an expense claim.
