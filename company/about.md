# About Made Tech

As a **purpose-driven organisation**, we believe the **outcomes** we create are more important than the technology we deliver.

## Our purpose – why we do what we do

We want to positively impact the future of the country by using **technology** to improve **society**.

We are already working with **brilliant public servants** to **modernise technology** and **accelerate digital delivery**. But we know we can do more to help those who share our vision.

## Our vision – what we want the future to look like

We want to **empower** the public sector to deliver and continuously improve digital services that are user-centric, data-driven and freed from legacy technology.

To achieve this, we help them to modernise working practices, accelerate digital delivery, drive better decisions through data and enable technology and delivery skills.


## Our missions – how we will get there

We empower public sector organisations by helping them to become digitally native.

- **Modernise** legacy technology and working practices
- **Accelerate** digital service and technology delivery
- **Drive** better decisions through data and automation
- **Enable** technology and delivery skills to build better systems

## Our values – who we are and how we operate

**Customer focussed** – We can only succeed in our mission if we are a trustworthy partner to the public sector. Through empathy, flexibility and pragmatism we build strong and lasting relationships with our customers.

**Drive to deliver** – We have a strong drive to deliver successful outcomes for our customers and their users, working hard to keep to our commitments, and rapidly delivering software that improves the lives of citizens.

**Learning & mentoring** – We are passionate about learning and growth, whether it’s an improvement of one's self, the team or the organisation, we recognise the power of continuous improvement.
