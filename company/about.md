# About Made Tech

As a **purpose-driven organisation**, we believe the **outcomes** we create are more important than the technology we deliver.

## Our purpose – why we do what we do

We want to positively impact the future of the country by using technology to improve society, **for everyone**.

We are already working with **brilliant public servants** to **modernise technology** and **accelerate digital delivery**. But we know we can do more to help those who share our vision.

## Our vision – what we want the future to look like

We want to **empower** the public sector to deliver and continuously improve digital services that are user-centric, data-driven and freed from legacy technology.

To achieve this, we help them to modernise working practices, accelerate digital delivery, drive better decisions through data and enable technology and delivery skills.

## Our missions – how we will get there

We empower public sector organisations by helping them to become digital by default.

- **Modernise** legacy technology and working practices
- **Accelerate** digital service and technology delivery
- **Drive** better decisions through data and automation
- **Enable** technology and delivery skills to build better systems

## Our values – who we are and how we operate

**Client focus** - we can only succeed in our mission if we’re a trustworthy partner to the public sector. We build strong and lasting relationships with our clients through empathy, flexibility, and pragmatism.

**Drive to deliver** - we have a strong drive to deliver successful outcomes for our clients and their users, working hard to keep to our commitments and rapidly delivering software that improve people’s lives.

**Learning and mentoring** - we’re passionate about learning and growth. Whether it's improving ourselves, the team, or the organisation, we believe in the power of continuous improvement.

**One team** - we collaborate with colleagues, clients and communities to create an environment which is inclusive, integrated, and where everyone supports delivery of the mission.
