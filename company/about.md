# About Made Tech

## Our purpose – why we exist

The UK faces significant problems, such as spiralling costs of healthcare, growing inequality and a failing welfare system. We will work side-by-side with brilliant public servants to support them in delivering better public services that can rise to these challenges.

## Our vision – what we want the future to look like

As public sector organisations reform and become digitally native; we’ll see a shift, where the software that underpins these organisations becomes their most valuable asset and provides the services citizens need and deserve.

## Our mission – how we will get there

To help the public sector build world-class technology teams, that practice the sort of techniques and ways of working you would see in an internet-era business.

We will:

- **Modernise** legacy technology and working practices
- **Accelerate** digital and technology delivery
- **Optimise** through smart use of data and automation
- **Enable** technology and delivery skills to build better systems

## Our values – who we are and how we operate

**Customer focussed** – We can only succeed in our mission if we are a trustworthy partner to the public sector. Through empathy, flexibility and pragmatism we build strong and lasting relationships with our customers.

**Drive to deliver** – We have a strong drive to deliver successful outcomes for our customers and their users, working hard to keep to our commitments, and rapidly delivering software that improves the lives of citizens.

**Learning & mentoring** – We are passionate about learning and growth, whether it’s an improvement of one's self, the team or the organisation, we recognise the power of continuous improvement.
